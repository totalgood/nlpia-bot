0,0,Chatbot,Background,"In 1950, Alan Turing's famous article ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" was published, which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence."
1,0,Chatbot,Background,"This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably—on the basis of the conversational content alone—between the program and a real human."
2,0,Chatbot,Background,"The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum's program ELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human."
3,0,Chatbot,Background,"However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:

"
4,0,Chatbot,Background,"[In] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer."
5,0,Chatbot,Background,"But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ..."
6,0,Chatbot,Background,"The observer says to himself ""I could have written that""."
7,0,Chatbot,Background,"With that thought he moves the program in question from the shelf marked ""intelligent"", to that reserved for curios ..."
8,0,Chatbot,Background,"The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be ""explained""."
9,0,Chatbot,Background,"Few programs ever needed it more.
"
10,0,Chatbot,Background,"ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY')."
11,0,Chatbot,Background,"Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial."
12,0,Chatbot,Background,"ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate, because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as ""intelligent"".
"
13,0,Chatbot,Background,Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational—even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching—can be exploited for useful purposes.
14,0,Chatbot,Background,"Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories."
15,0,Chatbot,Background,"Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a ""friendlier"" interface than a more formal search or menu system."
16,0,Chatbot,Background,"This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's ""shelf ... reserved for curios"" to that marked ""genuinely useful computational methods""."
17,0,Chatbot,Development,The classic historic early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) and PARRY (1972).
18,0,Chatbot,Development,"More recent notable programs include A.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky and D.U.D.E"

21,0,Chatbot,Development,"In 1984, a book called The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing."
22,0,Chatbot,Development,"Usually, weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required."
23,0,Chatbot,Development,"For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup language called AIML, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so called, Alicebots."
24,0,Chatbot,Development,"Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966."
25,0,Chatbot,Development,"This is not strong AI, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.
"
26,0,Chatbot,Development,"Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database."
27,0,Chatbot,Development,Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held.
28,0,Chatbot,Development,"Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, information retrieval.
"
29,0,Chatbot,Development,Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals.
30,0,Chatbot,Development,"Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however materials can still be found from web archives).DBpedia created a chatbot during the GSoC of 2017. and can communicate through Facebook Messenger."
31,0,Chatbot,Development,"DBpedia started in 2007 and allows to extract structured content from the Wikipedia dataset, along with many other datasets."

188,1,Twitterbot,Political,Deceiving Twitter bots fooled candidates and campaign staffers into retweeting misappropriated quotes and accounts affiliated with incendiary ideals.
189,1,Twitterbot,Political,"Concerns about political Twitter bots include the promulgation of malicious content, increased polarization, and the spreading of fake news."
190,1,Twitterbot,Positive influence,Many non-malicious bots are popular for their entertainment value.
191,1,Twitterbot,Positive influence,"However, as technology and the creativity of bot-makers improves, so does the potential for Twitter bots that fill social needs."
192,1,Twitterbot,Positive influence,"@tinycarebot is a Twitterbot that encourages followers to practice self care, and brands are increasingly using automated Twitter bots to engage with customers in interactive ways."
193,1,Twitterbot,Positive influence,"One anti-bullying organization has created @TheNiceBot, which attempts to combat the prevalence of mean tweets by automatically tweeting kind messages."
194,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,"The majority of Twitter accounts following public figures and brands are often fake or inactive, making the number of Twitter followers a celebrity a difficult metric for gauging popularity."
195,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,"While this cannot always be helped, some public figures who have gained or lost huge quantities of followers in short periods of time have been accused of discreetly paying for Twitter followers."
196,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,"For example, the Twitter accounts of Sean Combs, Rep Jared Polis (D-Colo), PepsiCo, Mercedes-Benz, and 50 Cent have come under scrutiny for possibly engaging in the buying and selling of Twitter followers, which is estimated to be between a $40 million and $360 million business annually."
197,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,Account sellers may charge a premium for more realistic accounts that have Twitter profile pictures and bios and retweet the accounts they follow.
198,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,"In addition to an ego boost, public figures may gain  more lucrative endorsement contracts from inflated Twitter metrics.  "
199,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,"For brands, however, the translation of online buzz and social media followers into sales has recently come under question after The Coca-Cola Company disclosed that a corporate study revealed that social media buzz does not create a spike in short term sales."
200,1,Social bot,Uses,"Lutz Finger identifies 5 immediate uses for social bots:
foster fame: having an arbitrary number of (unrevealed) bots as (fake) followers can help simulate real success
spamming: having advertising bots in online chats is similar to email spam, but a lot more direct
mischief:"
201,1,Social bot,Uses,"e.g. signing up an opponent with a lot of fake identities and spam the account or help others discover it to discreditize the opponent
bias public opinion: influence trends by countless messages of similar content with different phrasings
limit free speech: important messages can be pushed out of sight by a deluge of automated bot messagesThe effects of all points can be likened to and support methods of traditional psychological warfare."
202,1,Social bot,Detection,The first generation of bots could sometimes be distinguished from real users by their often superhuman capacities to post messages around the clock (and at massive rates).
203,1,Social bot,Detection,"Later developments have succeeded in imprinting more ""human"" activity and behavioral patterns in the agent."
204,1,Social bot,Detection,"To unambiguously detect social bots as what they are, a variety of criteria must be applied together using pattern detection techniques, some of which are:
cartoon figures as user pictures
sometimes also random real user pictures are captured (identity fraud)
reposting rate
temporal patterns
sentiment expression
followers-to-friends ratio
length of user names
variability in (re)posted messagesBotometer (formerly BotOrNot) is a public Web service that checks the activity of a Twitter account and gives it a score based on how likely the account is to be a bot."
205,1,Social bot,Detection,"The system leverages over a thousand features.
"
206,1,Social bot,Detection,An active method that worked well in detecting early spam bots was to set up honeypot accounts where obvious nonsensical content was posted and then dumbly reposted (retweeted) by bots.
207,1,Social bot,Detection,"However, recent studies show that bots evolve quickly and detection methods have to be updated constantly, because otherwise they may get useless after few years."
208,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,"Some bots communicate with other users of Internet-based services, via instant messaging (IM), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), or another web interface such as Facebook Bots and Twitterbots."
209,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,These chatterbots may allow people to ask questions in plain English and then formulate a proper response.
210,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,"These bots can often handle many tasks, including reporting weather, zip-code information, sports scores, converting currency or other units, etc."
211,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,"Others are used for entertainment, such as SmarterChild on AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger.
"
212,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,"An additional role of IRC bots may be to lurk in the background of a conversation channel, commenting on certain phrases uttered by the participants (based on pattern matching)."
213,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,"This is sometimes used as a help service for new users, or for censorship of profanity."
214,1,Internet bot,Social bots,Social networking bots are sets of algorithms that take on the duties of repetitive sets of instructions in order to establish a service or connection among social networking users.
215,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"Various designs of networking bots vary from chat bots, algorithms designed to converse with a human user, to social bots, algorithms designed to mimic human behaviors to converse with behavioral patterns similar to that of a human user."
216,1,Internet bot,Social bots,The history of social botting can be traced back to Alan Turing in the 1950s and his vision of designing sets of instructional code that passes the Turing test.
217,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"From 1964 to 1966, ELIZA, a natural language processing computer program created by Joseph Weizenbaum, is an early indicator of artificial intelligence algorithms that inspired computer programmers to design tasked programs that can match behavior patterns to their sets of instruction."
218,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"As a result, natural language processing has become an influencing factor to the development of artificial intelligence and social bots as innovative technological advancements are made alongside the progression of the mass spreading of information and thought on social media websites.
"
219,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"Reports of political interferences in recent elections, including the 2016 US and 2017 UK general elections, have set the notion of botting being more prevalent because of the ethics that is challenged between the bot's design and the bot's designer."
220,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"According to Emilio Ferrara, a computer scientist from the University of Southern California reporting on Communications of the ACM, the lack of resources available to implement fact-checking and information verification results in the large volumes of false reports and claims made on these bots in social media platforms."
221,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"In the case of Twitter, most of these bots are programmed with searching filter capabilities that target key words and phrases that reflect in favor and against political agendas and retweet them."
222,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"While the attention of bots is programmed to spread unverified information throughout the social media platform, it is a challenge that programmers face in the wake of a hostile political climate."
223,1,Internet bot,Social bots,Binary functions are designated to the programs and using an Application Program interface embedded in the social media website executes the functions tasked.
224,1,Internet bot,Social bots,The Bot Effect is what Ferrera reports as when the socialization of bots and human users creates a vulnerability to the leaking of personal information and polarizing influences outside the ethics of the bot's code.
225,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"According to Guillory Kramer in his study, he observes the behavior of emotionally volatile users and the impact the bots have on the users, altering the perception of reality."
226,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,There has been a great deal of controversy about the use of bots in an automated trading function.
227,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,Auction website eBay has been to court in an attempt to suppress a third-party company from using bots to traverse their site looking for bargains; this approach backfired on eBay and attracted the attention of further bots.
228,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"The United Kingdom-based bet exchange Betfair saw such a large amount of traffic coming from bots that it launched a WebService API aimed at bot programmers, through which it can actively manage bot interactions.
"
229,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"Bot farms are known to be used in online app stores, like the Apple App Store and Google Play, to manipulate positions or to increase positive ratings/reviews."

231,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"From 2016, when Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform, there has been an exponential growth of their use on that forum alone."
232,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"30,000 bots were created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017."
233,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"Avi Ben Ezra, CTO of SnatchBot, told Forbes that evidence from the use of their chatbot building platform pointed to a near future saving of millions of hours of human labour as 'live chat' on websites was replaced with bots."
234,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,Companies use internet bots to increase online engagement and streamline communication.
235,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"Companies often use bots to cut down on cost, instead of employing people to communicate with consumers, companies have developed new ways to be efficient."
236,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,These chatbots are used to answer customers' questions.
237,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"For example, Domino's has developed a chatbot that can take orders via Facebook Messenger."
238,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,Chatbots allow companies to allocate their employees' time to more important things.
239,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"A malicious use of bots is the coordination and operation of an automated attack on networked computers, such as a denial-of-service attack by a botnet."

248,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,Bots are employed against entertainment event-ticketing sites.
249,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,The bots are used by ticket brokers to unfairly obtain the best seats for themselves while depriving the general public of also having a chance to obtain the good seats.
250,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"The bot runs through the purchase process and obtains better seats by pulling as many seats back as it can.
"

in 2012, reporter Percy von Lipinski reported that he discovered millions of bot or botted or pinged views at CNN iReport."
255,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,CNN iReport quietly removed millions of views from the account of so-called superstar iReporter Chris Morrow.
256,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"It is not known if the ad revenue received by CNN from the fake views was ever returned to the advertisers.
"
257,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,Bots may be used on internet forums to automatically post inflammatory or nonsensical posts to disrupt the forum and anger users.
258,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"The most widely used anti-bot technique is the use of CAPTCHA, which is a form of Turing test used to distinguish between a human user and a less-sophisticated AI-powered bot, by the use of graphically-encoded human-readable text."
259,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"Examples of providers include Recaptcha, and commercial companies such as Minteye, Solve Media, and NuCaptcha."
260,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"Captchas, however, are not foolproof in preventing bots as they can often be circumvented by computer character recognition, security holes, and even by outsourcing captcha solving to cheap laborers."

270,2,Web brigades,Background,"State sponsored online sockpuppetry and manipulation of online views is practiced by several countries, in particular by Russia, China, United States, United Kingdom, Israel, Turkey, Iran, Vietnam, India and Ukraine."
271,2,Web brigades,Background,"The earliest documented allegations of the existence of ""web brigades"" appear to be in the April 2003 Vestnik Online article ""The Virtual Eye of Big Brother"" by French journalist Anna Polyanskaya (a former assistant to assassinated Russian politician Galina Starovoitova) and two other authors, Andrey Krivov and Ivan Lomako."
272,2,Web brigades,Background,"The authors claim that up to 1998, contributions to forums on Russian Internet sites (Runet) predominantly reflected liberal and democratic values, but after 2000, the vast majority of contributions reflected totalitarian values."
273,2,Web brigades,Background,This sudden change was attributed to the appearance of teams of pro-Russian commenters who appeared to be organized by the Russian state security service.
274,2,Web brigades,Background,"According to the authors, about 70% of Russian Internet posters were of generally liberal views prior to 1998–1999, while a surge of ""antidemocratic"" posts (about 60–80%) suddenly occurred at many Russian forums in 2000."
275,2,Web brigades,Background,"This could also be a reflection to the fact that access to Internet among the general Russian population soared during this time, which was until then accessible only to some sections of the society.
"
276,2,Web brigades,Background,"In January 2012, a hacktivist group calling itself the Russian arm of Anonymous published a massive collection of email allegedly belonging to former and present leaders of the pro-Kremlin youth organization Nashi (including a number of government officials)."
277,2,Web brigades,Background,Journalists who investigated the leaked information found that the pro-Kremlin movement had engaged in a range of activities including paying commentators to post content and hijacking blog ratings in the fall of 2011.
278,2,Web brigades,Background,"The e-mails indicated that members of the ""brigades"" were paid 85 rubles (about US$3) or more per comment, depending on whether the comment received replies."
279,2,Web brigades,Background,"Some were paid as much as 600,000 roubles (about US$21,000) for leaving hundreds of comments on negative press articles on the internet, and were presented with iPads."
280,2,Web brigades,Background,A number of high-profile bloggers were also mentioned as being paid for promoting Nashi and government activities.
281,2,Web brigades,Background,"The Federal Youth Agency, whose head (and the former leader of Nashi)"
282,2,Web brigades,Background,"Vasily Yakemenko was the highest-ranking individual targeted by the leaks, refused to comment on the authenticity of the e-mails."
283,2,Web brigades,Background,"In 2013, a Freedom House report stated that 22 of 60 countries examined have been using paid pro-government commentators to manipulate online discussions, and that Russia has been at the forefront of this practice for several years, along with China and Bahrain.  "
284,2,Web brigades,Background,"In the same year, Russian reporters investigated the St. Petersburg Internet Research Agency, which employs at least 400 people."
285,2,Web brigades,Background,"They found that the agency covertly hired young people as ""Internet operators"" paid to write pro-Kremlin postings and comments, smearing opposition leader Alexei Navalny and U.S. politics and culture.

"
286,2,Web brigades,Background,Some Russian opposition journalists state that such practices create a chilling effect on the few independent media outlets remaining in the country.
287,2,Web brigades,Background,"Further investigations were performed by Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and Institute of Modern Russia in 2014–15, inspired by the peak of activity of the pro-Russian brigades during the Ukrainian conflict and assassination of Boris Nemtsov."
288,2,Web brigades,Background,"The effort of using ""troll armies"" to promote Putin's policies is reported to be a multimillion-dollar operation."

323,2,Votebots,Techniques used,The WWW is built on HTTP protocol to transfer information.
324,2,Votebots,Techniques used,"To imitate legitimate user behavior, such as voting in an online poll, the attacker sends a HTTP request to particular server hosting the poll."
325,2,Votebots,Target analysis,"Analyzing the target, or the voting project, should be done before actually building the votebot."
326,2,Votebots,Target analysis,"When handling a voting website for example, one needs to do some webpage analysis on the target, extracting the request URL of the voting action as well as some HTTP header settings to cheat the website.
"
327,2,Votebots,Target analysis,"There are lots of tools which help people to analyze the web, such as Firebug and httpanalyzer."
328,2,Votebots,Target analysis,"One can trace the voting process of HTTP packages by these tools and find the right voting target and some simple protecting tricks used by websites, such as referrer verification."
329,2,Votebots,Preparation,"Before sending requests, the attacker must carefully analyze the target and identify potential attack vectors."
330,2,Votebots,Preparation,"During analysis, the attacker must determine if HTTP sessions (maintained via cookies) are necessary to consider or not."
331,2,Votebots,Preparation,"For example, an online poll could require a session so that only authorized users can vote."
332,2,Votebots,HTTP request,"Crafting an HTTP request defines how an actual user would behave based on parameters defined in the request.
"
333,2,Votebots,HTTP request,"Two HTTP request methods are useful in voting, POST and PUT."
334,2,Votebots,HTTP request,"Request methods are simply different ways to send data to a certain endpoint (i.e., a poll about ""How Many Users Like The Votebots Article?"").  "
335,2,Votebots,HTTP request,"The below is a simple Python example using httplib2 to send messages (cited from httplib2 wiki):

>>"
336,2,Votebots,HTTP request,> from httplib2 import

346,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"In many voting projects, developers try to distinguish the bots from legal users."
347,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"They may use the strategy talked about below, and the votebots try to bypass their barriers or detecting methods to successfully vote at the website.
"
348,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"For example, some websites restrict the number of votes one IP address can make in a time period."
349,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"Votebots can bypass this rule by proxy its IP address frequently to cheat the website.
"
350,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"Another frequently used strategy is to analyze the account created by a votebot to tell any difference from the normal accounts created by human beings, or to analyze the action history of accounts in the system to find out potential votebots creating ones."
351,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"Votebots, on the other hand, try to simulate human action such as logging in and out as well as sharing some articles in some social network service before voting."
352,2,Votebots,Usual target,YouTube is reported to be a big victim of votebots.
353,2,Votebots,Usual target,"Many small, temporary voting projects are also usual target of votebots."
354,2,Votebots,Usual target,"Many people try to program or buy malicious scripts to vote for themselves in some processes, and it is hard to count the number of attacks that happen every day."
355,2,Votebots,Anti-VoteBot,"As talked above, web developers want to distinguish votebot from legal voting users in voting projects."
356,2,Votebots,Anti-VoteBot,"Normal ways includes IP checking, account-handling, Turing test (e.g. CAPTCHA) and account action analysis."
357,3,Spambot,E-mail spambots,E-mail spambots harvest
358,3,Spambot,E-mail spambots,"e-mail addresses from material found on the Internet in order to build mailing lists for sending unsolicited e-mail, also known as spam."
359,3,Spambot,E-mail spambots,"Such spambots are web crawlers that can gather e-mail addresses from websites, newsgroups, special-interest group (SIG) postings, and chat-room conversations."
360,3,Spambot,E-mail spambots,"Because e-mail addresses have a distinctive format, such spambots are easy to code.
"
361,3,Spambot,E-mail spambots,A number of programs and approaches have been devised to foil spambots.
362,3,Spambot,E-mail spambots,"One such technique is address munging, in which an e-mail address is deliberately modified so that a human reader (and/or human-controlled web browser) can interpret it"
363,3,Spambot,E-mail spambots,but spambots cannot.
