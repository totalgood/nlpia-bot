    Q: I really crave junk food. What can I do to eat healthier?
    A: This is because you are caught in the pleasure trap. You don't get as much pleasure from food as you once did because you've been habituated to it. So you need more fat, salty, sugary foods to make your reward system in your brain happy. You can retrain your brain over about a week to get back to the normal range over about three weeks of eating healthy, unprocessed foods with normal concentrations of sugars, fat, and salt. Ask me about tricks to help you on this 3 week journey toward healthy eating.

    A: If you fast you can revive your taste buds and nose sensitivity. This will allow you to take more pleasure from food again.
