## Rikeem Syllabus

You want to progress down several skill paths in parallel, so you can use what you learn from one to help you with the others.
Though you should rotate between each of these, you should try to make more progress sooner on the more general foundational stuff, like wellbeing and development best practices, before the more practical specialized stuff like deep learning and computer vision. So these are listed in order of priority.

        - `~/src/project-archive/project-name/repo-name/.git` for your projects you haven't touched in several months
        - `~/src/reference/project-name/repo-name/.git` for others' code you just want to have the source code for
        - `~/src/other-peoples/project-name/repo-name/.git` external libraries that you don't import within your code

        - edit the `README.md` first to put down your plans and ideas for the project
        - `git status` right before your commit to see what files you've changed or added
        - `git commit -am 'message'` every hour or so if you've changed any files

        - `git log --stat` at the end of the day to review what you've accomplished and pat yourself on the back.
        - keep `~/.gitignore` up to date
        - `git add .` whenever you add a new file, before you write a single line in that file
        - `git push` once a week if you're on your own, once a week if you think anybody else is watching
        - `git log --stat` as soon as you start on a project to review what you did previously

## resources/lessons

To maintain your library of knowledge and to solidify understanding in your mind, you can "keep notes" in your text editor (IDE).
That way you can do a global find ([Super]-[Shift]-[F]) and retrieve your notes or code snippets if you want to use a technique on your own project.
