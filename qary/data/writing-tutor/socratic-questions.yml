clarification:

  - Why do you say that?
  - How does this relate to our discussion?
  - "Are you going to include diffusion in your mole balance equations?"

probe assumptions:

  - What could we assume instead?
  - How can you verify or disapprove that assumption?
  - "Why are neglecting radial diffusion and including only axial diffusion?"

reasons and evidence:

  - What would be an example?
  - What is....analogous to?
  - What do you think causes to happen...? Why:?
  - "Do you think that diffusion is responsible for the lower conversion?"

viewpoints and perspectives:

  - What would be an alternative?
  - What is another way to look at it?
  - Would you explain why it is necessary or beneficial, and who benefits?
  - Why is the best?
  - What are the strengths and weaknesses of...?
  - How are...and ...similar?
  - What is a counterargument for...?
  - "With all the bends in the pipe, from an industrial/practical standpoint, do you think diffusion will affect the conversion?"

probe implications and consequences:

  - What generalizations can you make?
  - What are the consequences of that assumption?
  - What are you implying?
  - How does...affect...?
  - How does...tie in with what we learned before?
  - "How would our results be affected if neglected diffusion?"

questions about a question:

  - What was the point of this question?
  - Why do you think I asked this question?
  - What does...mean?
  - How does...apply to everyday life?
  - "Why do you think diffusion is important?"
