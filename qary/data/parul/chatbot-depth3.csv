0,0,Chatbot,Background,"In 1950, Alan Turing's famous article ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" was published, which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence."
1,0,Chatbot,Background,"This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably—on the basis of the conversational content alone—between the program and a real human."
2,0,Chatbot,Background,"The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum's program ELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human."
3,0,Chatbot,Background,"However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:

"
4,0,Chatbot,Background,"[In] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer."
5,0,Chatbot,Background,"But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ..."
6,0,Chatbot,Background,"The observer says to himself ""I could have written that""."
7,0,Chatbot,Background,"With that thought he moves the program in question from the shelf marked ""intelligent"", to that reserved for curios ..."
8,0,Chatbot,Background,"The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be ""explained""."
9,0,Chatbot,Background,"Few programs ever needed it more.
"
10,0,Chatbot,Background,"ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY')."
11,0,Chatbot,Background,"Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial."
12,0,Chatbot,Background,"ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate, because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as ""intelligent"".
"
13,0,Chatbot,Background,Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational—even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching—can be exploited for useful purposes.
14,0,Chatbot,Background,"Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories."
15,0,Chatbot,Background,"Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a ""friendlier"" interface than a more formal search or menu system."
16,0,Chatbot,Background,"This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's ""shelf ... reserved for curios"" to that marked ""genuinely useful computational methods""."
17,0,Chatbot,Development,The classic historic early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) and PARRY (1972).
18,0,Chatbot,Development,"More recent notable programs include A.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky and D.U.D.E"

21,0,Chatbot,Development,"In 1984, a book called The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing."
22,0,Chatbot,Development,"Usually, weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required."
23,0,Chatbot,Development,"For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup language called AIML, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so called, Alicebots."
24,0,Chatbot,Development,"Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966."
25,0,Chatbot,Development,"This is not strong AI, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.
"
26,0,Chatbot,Development,"Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database."
27,0,Chatbot,Development,Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held.
28,0,Chatbot,Development,"Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, information retrieval.
"
29,0,Chatbot,Development,Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals.
30,0,Chatbot,Development,"Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however materials can still be found from web archives).DBpedia created a chatbot during the GSoC of 2017. and can communicate through Facebook Messenger."
31,0,Chatbot,Development,"DBpedia started in 2007 and allows to extract structured content from the Wikipedia dataset, along with many other datasets."

188,1,Twitterbot,Political,Deceiving Twitter bots fooled candidates and campaign staffers into retweeting misappropriated quotes and accounts affiliated with incendiary ideals.
189,1,Twitterbot,Political,"Concerns about political Twitter bots include the promulgation of malicious content, increased polarization, and the spreading of fake news."
190,1,Twitterbot,Positive influence,Many non-malicious bots are popular for their entertainment value.
191,1,Twitterbot,Positive influence,"However, as technology and the creativity of bot-makers improves, so does the potential for Twitter bots that fill social needs."
192,1,Twitterbot,Positive influence,"@tinycarebot is a Twitterbot that encourages followers to practice self care, and brands are increasingly using automated Twitter bots to engage with customers in interactive ways."
193,1,Twitterbot,Positive influence,"One anti-bullying organization has created @TheNiceBot, which attempts to combat the prevalence of mean tweets by automatically tweeting kind messages."
194,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,"The majority of Twitter accounts following public figures and brands are often fake or inactive, making the number of Twitter followers a celebrity a difficult metric for gauging popularity."
195,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,"While this cannot always be helped, some public figures who have gained or lost huge quantities of followers in short periods of time have been accused of discreetly paying for Twitter followers."
196,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,"For example, the Twitter accounts of Sean Combs, Rep Jared Polis (D-Colo), PepsiCo, Mercedes-Benz, and 50 Cent have come under scrutiny for possibly engaging in the buying and selling of Twitter followers, which is estimated to be between a $40 million and $360 million business annually."
197,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,Account sellers may charge a premium for more realistic accounts that have Twitter profile pictures and bios and retweet the accounts they follow.
198,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,"In addition to an ego boost, public figures may gain  more lucrative endorsement contracts from inflated Twitter metrics.  "
199,1,Twitterbot,Public figures,"For brands, however, the translation of online buzz and social media followers into sales has recently come under question after The Coca-Cola Company disclosed that a corporate study revealed that social media buzz does not create a spike in short term sales."
200,1,Social bot,Uses,"Lutz Finger identifies 5 immediate uses for social bots:
foster fame: having an arbitrary number of (unrevealed) bots as (fake) followers can help simulate real success
spamming: having advertising bots in online chats is similar to email spam, but a lot more direct
mischief:"
201,1,Social bot,Uses,"e.g. signing up an opponent with a lot of fake identities and spam the account or help others discover it to discreditize the opponent
bias public opinion: influence trends by countless messages of similar content with different phrasings
limit free speech: important messages can be pushed out of sight by a deluge of automated bot messagesThe effects of all points can be likened to and support methods of traditional psychological warfare."
202,1,Social bot,Detection,The first generation of bots could sometimes be distinguished from real users by their often superhuman capacities to post messages around the clock (and at massive rates).
203,1,Social bot,Detection,"Later developments have succeeded in imprinting more ""human"" activity and behavioral patterns in the agent."
204,1,Social bot,Detection,"To unambiguously detect social bots as what they are, a variety of criteria must be applied together using pattern detection techniques, some of which are:
cartoon figures as user pictures
sometimes also random real user pictures are captured (identity fraud)
reposting rate
temporal patterns
sentiment expression
followers-to-friends ratio
length of user names
variability in (re)posted messagesBotometer (formerly BotOrNot) is a public Web service that checks the activity of a Twitter account and gives it a score based on how likely the account is to be a bot."
205,1,Social bot,Detection,"The system leverages over a thousand features.
"
206,1,Social bot,Detection,An active method that worked well in detecting early spam bots was to set up honeypot accounts where obvious nonsensical content was posted and then dumbly reposted (retweeted) by bots.
207,1,Social bot,Detection,"However, recent studies show that bots evolve quickly and detection methods have to be updated constantly, because otherwise they may get useless after few years."
208,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,"Some bots communicate with other users of Internet-based services, via instant messaging (IM), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), or another web interface such as Facebook Bots and Twitterbots."
209,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,These chatterbots may allow people to ask questions in plain English and then formulate a proper response.
210,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,"These bots can often handle many tasks, including reporting weather, zip-code information, sports scores, converting currency or other units, etc."
211,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,"Others are used for entertainment, such as SmarterChild on AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger.
"
212,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,"An additional role of IRC bots may be to lurk in the background of a conversation channel, commenting on certain phrases uttered by the participants (based on pattern matching)."
213,1,Internet bot,IM and IRC,"This is sometimes used as a help service for new users, or for censorship of profanity."
214,1,Internet bot,Social bots,Social networking bots are sets of algorithms that take on the duties of repetitive sets of instructions in order to establish a service or connection among social networking users.
215,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"Various designs of networking bots vary from chat bots, algorithms designed to converse with a human user, to social bots, algorithms designed to mimic human behaviors to converse with behavioral patterns similar to that of a human user."
216,1,Internet bot,Social bots,The history of social botting can be traced back to Alan Turing in the 1950s and his vision of designing sets of instructional code that passes the Turing test.
217,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"From 1964 to 1966, ELIZA, a natural language processing computer program created by Joseph Weizenbaum, is an early indicator of artificial intelligence algorithms that inspired computer programmers to design tasked programs that can match behavior patterns to their sets of instruction."
218,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"As a result, natural language processing has become an influencing factor to the development of artificial intelligence and social bots as innovative technological advancements are made alongside the progression of the mass spreading of information and thought on social media websites.
"
219,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"Reports of political interferences in recent elections, including the 2016 US and 2017 UK general elections, have set the notion of botting being more prevalent because of the ethics that is challenged between the bot's design and the bot's designer."
220,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"According to Emilio Ferrara, a computer scientist from the University of Southern California reporting on Communications of the ACM, the lack of resources available to implement fact-checking and information verification results in the large volumes of false reports and claims made on these bots in social media platforms."
221,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"In the case of Twitter, most of these bots are programmed with searching filter capabilities that target key words and phrases that reflect in favor and against political agendas and retweet them."
222,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"While the attention of bots is programmed to spread unverified information throughout the social media platform, it is a challenge that programmers face in the wake of a hostile political climate."
223,1,Internet bot,Social bots,Binary functions are designated to the programs and using an Application Program interface embedded in the social media website executes the functions tasked.
224,1,Internet bot,Social bots,The Bot Effect is what Ferrera reports as when the socialization of bots and human users creates a vulnerability to the leaking of personal information and polarizing influences outside the ethics of the bot's code.
225,1,Internet bot,Social bots,"According to Guillory Kramer in his study, he observes the behavior of emotionally volatile users and the impact the bots have on the users, altering the perception of reality."
226,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,There has been a great deal of controversy about the use of bots in an automated trading function.
227,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,Auction website eBay has been to court in an attempt to suppress a third-party company from using bots to traverse their site looking for bargains; this approach backfired on eBay and attracted the attention of further bots.
228,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"The United Kingdom-based bet exchange Betfair saw such a large amount of traffic coming from bots that it launched a WebService API aimed at bot programmers, through which it can actively manage bot interactions.
"
229,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"Bot farms are known to be used in online app stores, like the Apple App Store and Google Play, to manipulate positions or to increase positive ratings/reviews."

231,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"From 2016, when Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform, there has been an exponential growth of their use on that forum alone."
232,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"30,000 bots were created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017."
233,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"Avi Ben Ezra, CTO of SnatchBot, told Forbes that evidence from the use of their chatbot building platform pointed to a near future saving of millions of hours of human labour as 'live chat' on websites was replaced with bots."
234,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,Companies use internet bots to increase online engagement and streamline communication.
235,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"Companies often use bots to cut down on cost, instead of employing people to communicate with consumers, companies have developed new ways to be efficient."
236,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,These chatbots are used to answer customers' questions.
237,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,"For example, Domino's has developed a chatbot that can take orders via Facebook Messenger."
238,1,Internet bot,Commercial bots,Chatbots allow companies to allocate their employees' time to more important things.
239,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"A malicious use of bots is the coordination and operation of an automated attack on networked computers, such as a denial-of-service attack by a botnet."

248,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,Bots are employed against entertainment event-ticketing sites.
249,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,The bots are used by ticket brokers to unfairly obtain the best seats for themselves while depriving the general public of also having a chance to obtain the good seats.
250,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"The bot runs through the purchase process and obtains better seats by pulling as many seats back as it can.
"
251,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"Bots are often used in Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games to farm for resources that would otherwise take significant time or effort to obtain; this is a concern for most online in-game economies.
"

in 2012, reporter Percy von Lipinski reported that he discovered millions of bot or botted or pinged views at CNN iReport."
255,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,CNN iReport quietly removed millions of views from the account of so-called superstar iReporter Chris Morrow.
256,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"It is not known if the ad revenue received by CNN from the fake views was ever returned to the advertisers.
"
257,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,Bots may be used on internet forums to automatically post inflammatory or nonsensical posts to disrupt the forum and anger users.
258,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"The most widely used anti-bot technique is the use of CAPTCHA, which is a form of Turing test used to distinguish between a human user and a less-sophisticated AI-powered bot, by the use of graphically-encoded human-readable text."
259,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"Examples of providers include Recaptcha, and commercial companies such as Minteye, Solve Media, and NuCaptcha."
260,1,Internet bot,Malicious bots,"Captchas, however, are not foolproof in preventing bots as they can often be circumvented by computer character recognition, security holes, and even by outsourcing captcha solving to cheap laborers."

270,2,Web brigades,Background,"State sponsored online sockpuppetry and manipulation of online views is practiced by several countries, in particular by Russia, China, United States, United Kingdom, Israel, Turkey, Iran, Vietnam, India and Ukraine."
271,2,Web brigades,Background,"The earliest documented allegations of the existence of ""web brigades"" appear to be in the April 2003 Vestnik Online article ""The Virtual Eye of Big Brother"" by French journalist Anna Polyanskaya (a former assistant to assassinated Russian politician Galina Starovoitova) and two other authors, Andrey Krivov and Ivan Lomako."
272,2,Web brigades,Background,"The authors claim that up to 1998, contributions to forums on Russian Internet sites (Runet) predominantly reflected liberal and democratic values, but after 2000, the vast majority of contributions reflected totalitarian values."
273,2,Web brigades,Background,This sudden change was attributed to the appearance of teams of pro-Russian commenters who appeared to be organized by the Russian state security service.
274,2,Web brigades,Background,"According to the authors, about 70% of Russian Internet posters were of generally liberal views prior to 1998–1999, while a surge of ""antidemocratic"" posts (about 60–80%) suddenly occurred at many Russian forums in 2000."
275,2,Web brigades,Background,"This could also be a reflection to the fact that access to Internet among the general Russian population soared during this time, which was until then accessible only to some sections of the society.
"
276,2,Web brigades,Background,"In January 2012, a hacktivist group calling itself the Russian arm of Anonymous published a massive collection of email allegedly belonging to former and present leaders of the pro-Kremlin youth organization Nashi (including a number of government officials)."
277,2,Web brigades,Background,Journalists who investigated the leaked information found that the pro-Kremlin movement had engaged in a range of activities including paying commentators to post content and hijacking blog ratings in the fall of 2011.
278,2,Web brigades,Background,"The e-mails indicated that members of the ""brigades"" were paid 85 rubles (about US$3) or more per comment, depending on whether the comment received replies."
279,2,Web brigades,Background,"Some were paid as much as 600,000 roubles (about US$21,000) for leaving hundreds of comments on negative press articles on the internet, and were presented with iPads."
280,2,Web brigades,Background,A number of high-profile bloggers were also mentioned as being paid for promoting Nashi and government activities.
281,2,Web brigades,Background,"The Federal Youth Agency, whose head (and the former leader of Nashi)"
282,2,Web brigades,Background,"Vasily Yakemenko was the highest-ranking individual targeted by the leaks, refused to comment on the authenticity of the e-mails."
283,2,Web brigades,Background,"In 2013, a Freedom House report stated that 22 of 60 countries examined have been using paid pro-government commentators to manipulate online discussions, and that Russia has been at the forefront of this practice for several years, along with China and Bahrain.  "
284,2,Web brigades,Background,"In the same year, Russian reporters investigated the St. Petersburg Internet Research Agency, which employs at least 400 people."
285,2,Web brigades,Background,"They found that the agency covertly hired young people as ""Internet operators"" paid to write pro-Kremlin postings and comments, smearing opposition leader Alexei Navalny and U.S. politics and culture.

"
286,2,Web brigades,Background,Some Russian opposition journalists state that such practices create a chilling effect on the few independent media outlets remaining in the country.
287,2,Web brigades,Background,"Further investigations were performed by Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and Institute of Modern Russia in 2014–15, inspired by the peak of activity of the pro-Russian brigades during the Ukrainian conflict and assassination of Boris Nemtsov."
288,2,Web brigades,Background,"The effort of using ""troll armies"" to promote Putin's policies is reported to be a multimillion-dollar operation."

323,2,Votebots,Techniques used,The WWW is built on HTTP protocol to transfer information.
324,2,Votebots,Techniques used,"To imitate legitimate user behavior, such as voting in an online poll, the attacker sends a HTTP request to particular server hosting the poll."
325,2,Votebots,Target analysis,"Analyzing the target, or the voting project, should be done before actually building the votebot."
326,2,Votebots,Target analysis,"When handling a voting website for example, one needs to do some webpage analysis on the target, extracting the request URL of the voting action as well as some HTTP header settings to cheat the website.
"
327,2,Votebots,Target analysis,"There are lots of tools which help people to analyze the web, such as Firebug and httpanalyzer."
328,2,Votebots,Target analysis,"One can trace the voting process of HTTP packages by these tools and find the right voting target and some simple protecting tricks used by websites, such as referrer verification."
329,2,Votebots,Preparation,"Before sending requests, the attacker must carefully analyze the target and identify potential attack vectors."
330,2,Votebots,Preparation,"During analysis, the attacker must determine if HTTP sessions (maintained via cookies) are necessary to consider or not."
331,2,Votebots,Preparation,"For example, an online poll could require a session so that only authorized users can vote."
332,2,Votebots,HTTP request,"Crafting an HTTP request defines how an actual user would behave based on parameters defined in the request.
"
333,2,Votebots,HTTP request,"Two HTTP request methods are useful in voting, POST and PUT."
334,2,Votebots,HTTP request,"Request methods are simply different ways to send data to a certain endpoint (i.e., a poll about ""How Many Users Like The Votebots Article?"").  "
335,2,Votebots,HTTP request,"The below is a simple Python example using httplib2 to send messages (cited from httplib2 wiki):

>>"
336,2,Votebots,HTTP request,> from httplib2 import

346,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"In many voting projects, developers try to distinguish the bots from legal users."
347,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"They may use the strategy talked about below, and the votebots try to bypass their barriers or detecting methods to successfully vote at the website.
"
348,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"For example, some websites restrict the number of votes one IP address can make in a time period."
349,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"Votebots can bypass this rule by proxy its IP address frequently to cheat the website.
"
350,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"Another frequently used strategy is to analyze the account created by a votebot to tell any difference from the normal accounts created by human beings, or to analyze the action history of accounts in the system to find out potential votebots creating ones."
351,2,Votebots,Human action simulation,"Votebots, on the other hand, try to simulate human action such as logging in and out as well as sharing some articles in some social network service before voting."
352,2,Votebots,Usual target,YouTube is reported to be a big victim of votebots.
353,2,Votebots,Usual target,"Many small, temporary voting projects are also usual target of votebots."
354,2,Votebots,Usual target,"Many people try to program or buy malicious scripts to vote for themselves in some processes, and it is hard to count the number of attacks that happen every day."
355,2,Votebots,Anti-VoteBot,"As talked above, web developers want to distinguish votebot from legal voting users in voting projects."
356,2,Votebots,Anti-VoteBot,"Normal ways includes IP checking, account-handling, Turing test (e.g. CAPTCHA) and account action analysis."
357,2,Spambot,E-mail spambots,E-mail spambots harvest
358,2,Spambot,E-mail spambots,"e-mail addresses from material found on the Internet in order to build mailing lists for sending unsolicited e-mail, also known as spam."
359,2,Spambot,E-mail spambots,"Such spambots are web crawlers that can gather e-mail addresses from websites, newsgroups, special-interest group (SIG) postings, and chat-room conversations."
360,2,Spambot,E-mail spambots,"Because e-mail addresses have a distinctive format, such spambots are easy to code.
"
361,2,Spambot,E-mail spambots,A number of programs and approaches have been devised to foil spambots.
362,2,Spambot,E-mail spambots,"One such technique is address munging, in which an e-mail address is deliberately modified so that a human reader (and/or human-controlled web browser) can interpret it"
363,2,Spambot,E-mail spambots,but spambots cannot.
364,2,Spambot,E-mail spambots,"This has led to the evolution of more sophisticated spambots that are able to recover e-mail addresses from character strings that appear to be munged, or instead can render the text into a web browser and then scrape it for e-mail addresses."
365,2,Spambot,E-mail spambots,"Alternative transparent techniques include displaying all or part of the e-mail address on a web page as an image, a text logo shrunken to normal size using inline CSS, or as text with the order of characters jumbled, placed into readable order at display time using CSS."
366,2,Spambot,Forum spambots,"Forum spambots browse the internet, looking for guestbooks, wikis, blogs, forums, and other types of web forms that they can then use to submit bogus content."
367,2,Spambot,Forum spambots,These often use OCR technology to bypass CAPTCHAs.
368,2,Spambot,Forum spambots,"Some spam messages are targeted towards readers and can involve techniques of target marketing or even phishing, making it hard to tell real posts from the bot generated ones."
369,2,Spambot,Forum spambots,"Other spam messages are not meant to be read by humans, but are instead posted to increase the number of links to a particular website, to boost its search engine ranking.
"
370,2,Spambot,Forum spambots,One way to prevent spambots from creating automated posts is to require the poster to confirm their intention to post via e-mail.
371,2,Spambot,Forum spambots,"Since most spambot scripts use a fake e-mail address when posting, any email confirmation request is unlikely to be successfully routed to them."
372,2,Spambot,Forum spambots,"Some spambots will pass this step by providing a valid email address and use it for validation, mostly via webmail services."
373,2,Spambot,Forum spambots,"Using methods such as security questions are also proven to be effective in curbing posts generated by spambots, as they are usually unable to answer it upon registering."
374,2,Spambot,Twitter spambots,"A Twitterbot is a program used to produce automated posts on the Twitter microblogging service, or to automatically follow Twitter users."
375,2,Spambot,Twitter spambots,Twitterbots come in various forms.
376,2,Spambot,Twitter spambots,"For example, many serve as spam, enticing clicks on promotional links."
377,2,Spambot,Twitter spambots,"Others post @replies or automatically ""retweet"" in response to tweets that include a certain word or phrase."
378,2,Spambot,Twitter spambots,These automatic tweets are often seen as fun or silly.
379,2,Spambot,Twitter spambots,Some Twitter users even program Twitterbots to assist themselves with scheduling or reminders.
380,2,Software agent,Concepts,"The basic attributes of an autonomous software agent are that agents

are not strictly invoked for a task, but activate themselves,
may reside in wait status on a host, perceiving context,
may get to run status on a host upon starting conditions,
do not require interaction of user,
may invoke other tasks including communication.
"
381,2,Software agent,Concepts,"The term ""agent"" describes a software abstraction, an idea, or a concept, similar to OOP terms such as methods, functions, and objects."
382,2,Software agent,Concepts,The concept of an agent provides a convenient and powerful way to describe a complex software entity that is capable of acting with a certain degree of autonomy in order to accomplish  tasks on behalf of its host.
383,2,Software agent,Concepts,"But unlike objects, which are defined in terms of methods and attributes, an agent is defined in terms of its behavior.
"
384,2,Software agent,Concepts,"Various authors have proposed different definitions of agents, these commonly include concepts such as

persistence (code is not executed on demand but runs continuously and decides for itself when it should perform some activity)
autonomy (agents have capabilities of task selection, prioritization, goal-directed behavior, decision-making without human intervention)
social ability (agents are able to engage other components through some sort of communication and coordination, they may collaborate on a task)
reactivity (agents perceive the context in which they operate and react to it appropriately)."
385,2,Software agent,Distinguishing agents from programs,"All agents are programs, but not all programs are agents.
"
386,2,Software agent,Distinguishing agents from programs,Contrasting the term with related concepts may help clarify its meaning.
387,2,Software agent,Distinguishing agents from programs,"Franklin & Graesser (1997) discuss four key notions that distinguish agents from arbitrary programs: reaction to the environment, autonomy, goal-orientation and persistence."
388,2,Software agent,Intuitive distinguishing agents from objects,"Agents are more autonomous than objects.
"
389,2,Software agent,Intuitive distinguishing agents from objects,"Agents have flexible behaviour: reactive, proactive, social.
"
390,2,Software agent,Intuitive distinguishing agents from objects,Agents have at least one thread of control but may have more.
391,2,Software agent,Distinguishing agents from expert systems,"Expert systems are not coupled to their environment.
"
392,2,Software agent,Distinguishing agents from expert systems,"Expert systems are not designed for reactive, proactive behavior.
"
393,2,Software agent,Distinguishing agents from expert systems,Expert systems do not consider social ability.
394,2,Software agent,Distinguishing intelligent software agents from intelligent agents in AI,"Intelligent agents (also known as rational agents) are not just computer programs: they may also be machines, human beings, communities of human beings (such as firms) or anything that is capable of goal-directed behavior.(Russell & Norvig 2003)"
395,2,Software agent,Impact of software agents,Software agents may offer various benefits to their end users by automating complex or repetitive tasks.
396,2,Software agent,Impact of software agents,"However, there are organizational and cultural impacts of this technology that need to be considered prior to implementing software agents."
397,2,Software agent,Work contentment and job satisfaction impact,People like to perform easy tasks providing the sensation of success unless the repetition of the simple tasking is affecting the overall output.
398,2,Software agent,Work contentment and job satisfaction impact,"In general implementing software agents to perform administrative requirements provides a substantial increase in work contentment, as administering their own work does never please the worker."
399,2,Software agent,Work contentment and job satisfaction impact,The effort freed up serves for a higher degree of engagement in the substantial tasks of individual work.
400,2,Software agent,Work contentment and job satisfaction impact,"Hence, software agents may provide the basics to implement self-controlled work, relieved from hierarchical controls and interference."
401,2,Software agent,Work contentment and job satisfaction impact,Such conditions may be secured by application of software agents for required formal support.
402,2,Software agent,Cultural impact,"The cultural effects of the implementation of software agents include trust affliction, skills erosion, privacy attrition and social detachment."
403,2,Software agent,Cultural impact,Some users may not feel entirely comfortable fully delegating important tasks to software applications.
404,2,Software agent,Cultural impact,"Those who start relying solely on intelligent agents may lose important skills, for example, relating to information literacy."
405,2,Software agent,Cultural impact,"In order to act on a user's behalf, a software agent needs to have a complete understanding of a user's profile, including his/her personal preferences."
406,2,Software agent,Cultural impact,"This, in turn, may lead to unpredictable privacy issues."
407,2,Software agent,Cultural impact,"When users start relying on their software agents more, especially for communication activities, they may lose contact with other human users and look at the world with the eyes of their agents."
408,2,Software agent,Cultural impact,These consequences are what agent researchers and users must consider when dealing with intelligent agent technologies.
409,2,Software agent,History,"The concept of an agent can be traced back to Hewitt's Actor Model (Hewitt, 1977) - ""A self-contained, interactive and concurrently-executing object, possessing internal state and communication capability."
410,2,Software agent,History,"To be more academic, software agent systems are a direct evolution of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)."

454,2,Software agent,Design issues,"Issues to consider in the development of agent-based systems include

how tasks are scheduled and how synchronization of tasks is achieved
how tasks are prioritized by agents
how agents can collaborate, or recruit resources,
how agents can be re-instantiated in different environments, and how their internal state can be stored,
how the environment will be probed and how a change of environment leads to behavioral changes of the agents
how messaging and communication can be achieved,
what hierarchies of agents are useful (e.g. task execution agents, scheduling agents, resource providers ...)"
455,2,Software agent,Design issues,.For
456,2,Software agent,Design issues,software agents to work together efficiently
457,2,Software agent,Design issues,they must share semantics of their data elements.
458,2,Software agent,Design issues,"This can be done by having computer systems publish their metadata.
"
459,2,Software agent,Design issues,"The definition of agent processing can be approached from two interrelated directions:

internal state processing and ontologies for representing knowledge
interaction protocols – standards for specifying communication of tasksAgent systems are used to model real-world systems with concurrency or parallel processing.

"
460,2,Software agent,Design issues,"Agent Machinery – Engines of various kinds, which support the varying degrees of intelligence
Agent Content – Data employed by the machinery in Reasoning and Learning
Agent Access – Methods to enable the machinery to perceive content and perform actions as outcomes of Reasoning
Agent Security – Concerns related to distributed computing, augmented by a few special concerns related to agentsThe agent uses its access methods to go out into local and remote databases to forage for content."
461,2,Software agent,Design issues,"These access methods may include setting up news stream delivery to the agent, or retrieval from bulletin boards, or using a spider to walk the Web."
462,2,Software agent,Design issues,The content that is retrieved in this way is probably already partially filtered – by the selection of the newsfeed or the databases that are searched.
463,2,Software agent,Design issues,The agent next may use its detailed searching or language-processing machinery to extract keywords or signatures from the body of the content that has been received or retrieved.
464,2,Software agent,Design issues,This abstracted content (or event) is then passed to the agent's Reasoning or inferencing machinery in order to decide what to do with the new content.
465,2,Software agent,Design issues,This process combines the event content with the rule-based or knowledge content provided by the user.
466,2,Software agent,Design issues,"If this process finds a good hit or match in the new content, the agent may use another piece of its machinery to do a more detailed search on the content."
467,2,Software agent,Design issues,"Finally, the agent may decide to take an action based on the new content; for example, to notify the user that an important event has occurred."
468,2,Software agent,Design issues,This action is verified by a security function and then given the authority of the user.
469,2,Software agent,Design issues,The agent makes use of a user-access method to deliver that message to the user.
470,2,Software agent,Design issues,"If the user confirms that the event is important by acting quickly on the notification, the agent may also employ its learning machinery to increase its weighting for this kind of event.
"
471,2,Software agent,Design issues,Bots can act on behalf of their creators to do good as well as bad.
472,2,Software agent,Design issues,There are a few ways which bots can be created to demonstrate that they are designed with the best intention and are not built to do harm.
473,2,Software agent,Design issues,This is first done by having a bot identify itself in the user-agent HTTP header when communicating with a site.
474,2,Software agent,Design issues,The source IP address must also be validated to establish itself as legitimate.
475,2,Software agent,Design issues,"Next, the bot must also always respect a site's robots.txt file since it has become the standard across most of the web."
476,2,Software agent,Design issues,"And like respecting the robots.txt file, bots should shy away from being too aggressive and respect any crawl delay instructions."

480,2,IRC bot,Function,"Often, an IRC bot is deployed as a detached program running from a stable host.  "
481,2,IRC bot,Function,It sits on an IRC channel to keep it open and prevents malicious users from taking over the channel.
482,2,IRC bot,Function,"It can be configured to give channel operator status to privileged users when they join the channel, and can provide a unified channel operator list."
483,2,IRC bot,Function,Many of these features require that the bot be a channel operator.
484,2,IRC bot,Function,"Thus, most IRC bots are run from computers which have long uptimes (generally running a BSD derivative or Linux) and a fast, stable Internet connection.  "
485,2,IRC bot,Function,"As IRC has become popular with many dial-up users as well, shell accounts at shell providers have become popular as a stable Linux server with a decent connection to run a bot from.
"
486,2,IRC bot,Function,"Aside from managing channel permissions, a bot can also perform functions such as logging what is posted to an IRC channel, giving out information on demand (very popular in IRC channels dealing with user support), creating statistics tracking the channel's top posters and longest-lived lurkers, or hosting trivia, Uno and other games.  "
487,2,IRC bot,Function,"These functions are usually provided by scripts, often written in a scripting programming language such as Tcl or Perl by the bot's users."
488,2,IRC bot,Function,"Channels dedicated to file sharing often use XDCC bots to distribute their files.

493,2,IRC bot,Function,"Such server-sanctioned bots are called IRC services.
"
494,2,IRC bot,Function,Bots are not always welcome.
495,2,IRC bot,Function,Some IRC networks forbid the usage of bots.
496,2,IRC bot,Function,One of the reasons for doing so is that each nickname connected to the network increases the size of the network database which is being kept in sync across all servers.
497,2,IRC bot,Function,Allowing for bots in large networks can cause a relevant amount of network traffic overhead which needs to be financed and may even lead to netsplits.

518,2,Facebook Bots,Features,"The following is a table of features available in Facebook Messenger, as well as their geographical coverage and what devices they are available on:"
519,2,Facebook Bots,Monetization,"In January 2017, Facebook announced that it was testing showing advertisements in Facebook Messenger's home feed."
520,2,Facebook Bots,Monetization,"At the time, the testing was limited to a ""small number of users in Australia and Thailand"", with the ad format being swipe-based carousel ads."
521,2,Facebook Bots,Monetization,"In July, the company announced that they were expanding the testing to a global audience."
522,2,Facebook Bots,Monetization,"Stan Chudnovsky, head of Messenger, told VentureBeat that ""We'll start slow ..."
523,2,Facebook Bots,Monetization,"When the average user can be sure to see them we truly don't know because we're just going to be very data-driven and user feedback-driven on making that decision""."
524,2,Facebook Bots,Monetization,"Facebook told TechCrunch that the advertisements' placement in the inbox depends on factors such as thread count, phone screen size, and pixel density."
525,2,Facebook Bots,Monetization,"In a TechCrunch editorial by Devin Coldewey, he described the ads as ""huge"" in the space they occupy, ""intolerable"" in the way they appear in the user interface, and ""irrelevant"" due to the lack of context."
526,2,Facebook Bots,Monetization,"Coldewey finished by writing ""Advertising is how things get paid for on the internet, including TechCrunch, so I'm not an advocate of eliminating it or blocking it altogether."
527,2,Facebook Bots,Monetization,But bad advertising experiences can spoil a perfectly good app like (for the purposes of argument) Messenger.
528,2,Facebook Bots,Monetization,"Messaging is a personal, purposeful use case and these ads are a bad way to monetize it."
529,2,Facebook Bots,Reception,"In November 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) listed Facebook Messenger (Facebook chat) on its Secure Messaging Scorecard."
530,2,Facebook Bots,Reception,It received a score of 2 out of 7 points on the scorecard.
531,2,Facebook Bots,Reception,It received points for having communications encrypted in transit and for having recently completed an independent security audit.
532,2,Facebook Bots,Reception,"It missed points because the communications were not encrypted with keys the provider didn't have access to, users could not verify contacts' identities, past messages were not secure if the encryption keys were stolen, the source code was not open to independent review, and the security design was not properly documented."
533,2,Facebook Bots,Reception,"As stated by Facebook in its Help Center, there is no way to log out of the Facebook Messenger application."
534,2,Facebook Bots,Reception,"Instead, users can choose between different availability statuses, including ""Appear as inactive"", ""Switch accounts"", and ""Turn off notifications""."
535,2,Facebook Bots,Reception,"Media outlets have reported on a workaround, by pressing a ""Clear data"" option in the application's menu in Settings on Android devices, which returns the user to the log-in screen."
536,2,Facebook Bots,User growth,"After being separated from the main Facebook app, Facebook Messenger had 600 million users in April 2015."
537,2,Facebook Bots,User growth,"This grew to 900 million in June 2016, 1 billion in July 2016, and 1.2 billion in April 2017."
538,2,Facebook Bots,Government attempt at surveillance/decryption,"In early 2018, the US Department of Justice went to court to attempt to force Facebook to modify its Messenger app to enable surveillance by third parties so that agents could listen in on encrypted voice conversations over Messenger.

544,2,Botnet,Overview,"A botnet is a logical collection of Internet-connected devices such as computers, smartphones or IoT devices whose security have been breached and control ceded to a third party."
545,2,Botnet,Overview,"Each compromised device, known as a ""bot"", is created when a device is penetrated by software from a malware (malicious software) distribution."
546,2,Botnet,Overview,"The controller of a botnet is able to direct the activities of these compromised computers through communication channels formed by standards-based network protocols, such as IRC and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).Botnets are increasingly rented out by cyber criminals as commodities for a variety of purposes."
547,2,Botnet,Architecture,Botnet architecture has evolved over time in an effort to evade detection and disruption.
548,2,Botnet,Architecture,"Traditionally, bot programs are constructed as clients which communicate via existing servers."
549,2,Botnet,Architecture,"This allows the bot herder (the person controlling the botnet) to perform all control from a remote location, which obfuscates their traffic."
550,2,Botnet,Architecture,Many recent botnets now rely on existing peer-to-peer networks to communicate.
551,2,Botnet,Architecture,"These P2P bot programs perform the same actions as the client-server model, but they do not require a central server to communicate."
552,2,Botnet,Client-server model,The first botnets on the internet used a client-server model to accomplish their tasks.
553,2,Botnet,Client-server model,"Typically, these botnets operate through Internet Relay Chat networks, domains, or websites."
554,2,Botnet,Client-server model,Infected clients access a predetermined location and await incoming commands from the server.
555,2,Botnet,Client-server model,"The bot herder sends commands to the server, which relays them to the clients."
556,2,Botnet,Client-server model,"Clients execute the commands and report their results back to the bot herder.
"
557,2,Botnet,Client-server model,"In the case of IRC botnets, infected clients connect to an infected IRC server and join a channel pre-designated for C&C by the bot herder."
558,2,Botnet,Client-server model,The bot herder sends commands to the channel via the IRC server.
559,2,Botnet,Client-server model,Each client retrieves the commands and executes them.
560,2,Botnet,Client-server model,Clients send messages back to the IRC channel with the results of their actions.
561,2,Botnet,Peer-to-peer,"In response to efforts to detect and decapitate IRC botnets, bot herders have begun deploying malware on peer-to-peer networks."
562,2,Botnet,Peer-to-peer,These bots may use digital signatures so that only someone with access to the private key can control the botnet.
563,2,Botnet,Peer-to-peer,"See e.g. Gameover ZeuS and ZeroAccess botnet.
"
564,2,Botnet,Peer-to-peer,Newer botnets fully operate over P2P networks.
565,2,Botnet,Peer-to-peer,"Rather than communicate with a centralized server, P2P bots perform as both a command distribution server and a client which receives commands."
566,2,Botnet,Peer-to-peer,"This avoids having any single point of failure, which is an issue for centralized botnets.
"
567,2,Botnet,Peer-to-peer,"In order to find other infected machines, the bot discreetly probes random IP addresses until it contacts another infected machine."
568,2,Botnet,Peer-to-peer,The contacted bot replies with information such as its software version and list of known bots.
569,2,Botnet,Peer-to-peer,"If one of the bots' version is lower than the other, they will initiate a file transfer to update."
570,2,Botnet,Peer-to-peer,"This way, each bot grows its list of infected machines and updates itself by periodically communicating to all known bots."
571,2,Botnet,Core components,"A botnet's originator (known as a ""bot herder"" or ""bot master"") controls the botnet remotely."
572,2,Botnet,Core components,This is known as the command-and-control (C&C).
573,2,Botnet,Core components,The program for the operation which must communicate via a covert channel to the client on the victim's machine (zombie computer).
574,2,Botnet,Control protocols,IRC is a historically favored means of C&C because of its communication protocol.
575,2,Botnet,Control protocols,A bot herder creates an IRC channel for infected clients to join.
576,2,Botnet,Control protocols,Messages sent to the channel are broadcast to all channel members.
577,2,Botnet,Control protocols,The bot herder may set the channel's topic to command the botnet.
578,2,Botnet,Control protocols,E.g. the message :herder!herder@example.com TOPIC #channel DDoS www.victim.com from the bot herder alerts all infected clients belonging to #channel to begin a DDoS attack on the website www.victim.com.
579,2,Botnet,Control protocols,An example response :bot1!bot1@compromised.net PRIVMSG #channel
580,2,Botnet,Control protocols,I am DDoSing www.victim.com by a bot client alerts the bot herder that it has begun the attack.
581,2,Botnet,Control protocols,Some botnets implement custom versions of well-known protocols.
582,2,Botnet,Control protocols,The implementation differences can be used for detection of botnets.
583,2,Botnet,Control protocols,"For example, Mega-D features a slightly modified SMTP implementation for testing spam capability."
584,2,Botnet,Control protocols,Bringing down the Mega-D's SMTP server disables the entire pool of bots that rely upon the same SMTP server.
585,2,Botnet,Zombie computer,"In computer science, a zombie computer is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse and can be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction."
586,2,Botnet,Zombie computer,Botnets of zombie computers are often used to spread e-mail spam and launch denial-of-service attacks.
587,2,Botnet,Zombie computer,Most owners of zombie computers are unaware that their system is being used in this way.
588,2,Botnet,Zombie computer,"Because the owner tends to be unaware, these computers are metaphorically compared to zombies."
589,2,Botnet,Zombie computer,A coordinated DDoS attack by multiple botnet machines also resembles a zombie horde attack.
590,2,Botnet,Zombie computer,Many computer users are unaware that their computer is infected with bots.
591,2,Botnet,Zombie computer,"The process of stealing computing resources as a result of a system being joined to a ""botnet"" is sometimes referred to as ""scrumping""."
592,2,Botnet,Command and control,"Botnet Command and control (C&C) protocols have been implemented in a number of ways, from traditional IRC approaches to more sophisticated versions."
593,2,Botnet,Telnet,Telnet botnets use a simple C&C botnet Protocol in which bots connect to the main command server to host the botnet.
594,2,Botnet,Telnet,"Bots are added to the botnet by using a scanning script, the scanning script is run on an external server and scans IP ranges for telnet and SSH server default logins."
595,2,Botnet,Telnet,Once a login is found it is added to an infection list and infected with a malicious infection line via SSH on from the scanner server.
596,2,Botnet,Telnet,When the SSH command is run it infects the server and commands the server to ping to the control server and becomes its slave from the malicious code infecting it.
597,2,Botnet,Telnet,Once servers are infected to the server the bot controller can launch DDoS attacks of high volume using the C&C panel on the host server.
598,2,Botnet,IRC,"IRC networks use simple, low bandwidth communication methods, making them widely used to host botnets."
599,2,Botnet,IRC,They tend to be relatively simple in construction and have been used with moderate success for coordinating DDoS attacks and spam campaigns while being able to continually switch channels to avoid being taken down.
600,2,Botnet,IRC,"However, in some cases, merely blocking of certain keywords has proven effective in stopping IRC-based botnets."
601,2,Botnet,IRC,The RFC 1459 (IRC) standard is popular with botnets.
602,2,Botnet,IRC,"The first known popular botnet controller script, ""MaXiTE Bot"" was using IRC XDCC protocol for private control commands.
"
603,2,Botnet,IRC,"One problem with using IRC is that each bot client must know the IRC server, port, and channel to be of any use to the botnet."
604,2,Botnet,IRC,"Anti-malware organizations can detect and shut down these servers and channels, effectively halting the botnet attack."
605,2,Botnet,IRC,"If this happens, clients are still infected, but they typically lie dormant since they have no way of receiving instructions."
606,2,Botnet,IRC,"To mitigate this problem, a botnet can consist of several servers or channels."
607,2,Botnet,IRC,"If one of the servers or channels becomes disabled, the botnet simply switches to another."
608,2,Botnet,IRC,It is still possible to detect and disrupt additional botnet servers or channels by sniffing IRC traffic.
609,2,Botnet,IRC,A botnet adversary can even potentially gain knowledge of the control scheme and imitate the bot herder by issuing commands correctly.
610,2,Botnet,P2P,"Since most botnets using IRC networks and domains can be taken down with time, hackers have moved to P2P botnets with C&C as a way to make it harder to be taken down.
"
611,2,Botnet,P2P,"Some have also used encryption as a way to secure or lock down the botnet from others, most of the time when they use encryption it is public-key cryptography and has presented challenges in both implementing it and breaking it."
612,2,Botnet,Domains,Many large botnets tend to use domains rather than IRC in their construction (see Rustock botnet and Srizbi botnet).
613,2,Botnet,Domains,They are usually hosted with bulletproof hosting services.
614,2,Botnet,Domains,This is one of the earliest types of
615,2,Botnet,Domains,C&C. A zombie computer accesses a specially-designed webpage or domain(s) which serves the list of controlling commands.
616,2,Botnet,Domains,"The advantages of using web pages or domains as C&C is that a large botnet can be effectively controlled and maintained with very simple code that can be readily updated.
"
617,2,Botnet,Domains,"Disadvantages of using this method are that it uses a considerable amount of bandwidth at large scale, and domains can be quickly seized by government agencies without much trouble or effort."
618,2,Botnet,Domains,"If the domains controlling the botnets are not seized, they are also easy targets to compromise with denial-of-service attacks.
"
619,2,Botnet,Domains,"Fast-flux DNS can be used as a way to make it difficult to track down the control servers, which may change from day to day."
620,2,Botnet,Domains,"Control servers may also hop from DNS domain to DNS domain, with domain generation algorithms being used to create new DNS names for controller servers.
"
621,2,Botnet,Domains,"Some botnets use free DNS hosting services such as DynDns.org, No-IP.com, and Afraid.org to point a subdomain towards an IRC server that harbors the bots."
622,2,Botnet,Domains,"While these free DNS services do not themselves host attacks, they provide reference points (often hard-coded into the botnet executable)."
623,2,Botnet,Domains,Removing such services can cripple an entire botnet.
624,2,Botnet,Others,"Calling back to large social media sites such as GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, the XMPP open source instant message protocol and Tor hidden services are popular ways of avoiding egress filtering to communicate with a C&C server."
625,2,Botnet,Traditional,"This example illustrates how a botnet is created and used for malicious gain.

"
626,2,Botnet,Traditional,"A hacker purchases or builds a Trojan and/or exploit kit and uses it to start infecting users' computers, whose payload is a malicious application"
627,2,Botnet,Traditional,"—the bot.
"
628,2,Botnet,Traditional,The bot instructs the infected PC to connect to a particular command-and-control (C&C) server.
629,2,Botnet,Traditional,"(This allows the botmaster to keep logs of how many bots are active and online.)
"
630,2,Botnet,Traditional,"The botmaster may then use the bots to gather keystrokes or use form grabbing to steal online credentials and may rent out the botnet as DDoS and/or spam as a service or sell the credentials online for a profit.
"
631,2,Botnet,Traditional,"Depending on the quality and capability of the bots, the value is increased or decreased."
632,2,Botnet,Traditional,Newer bots can automatically scan their environment and propagate themselves using vulnerabilities and weak passwords.
633,2,Botnet,Traditional,"Generally, the more vulnerabilities a bot can scan and propagate through, the more valuable it becomes to a botnet controller community."
634,2,Botnet,Traditional,Computers can be co-opted into a botnet when they execute malicious software.
635,2,Botnet,Traditional,"This can be accomplished by luring users into making a drive-by download, exploiting web browser vulnerabilities, or by tricking the user into running a Trojan horse program, which may come from an email attachment."
636,2,Botnet,Traditional,This malware will typically install modules that allow the computer to be commanded and controlled by the botnet's operator.
637,2,Botnet,Traditional,"After the software is downloaded, it will call home (send a reconnection packet) to the host computer."
638,2,Botnet,Traditional,"When the re-connection is made, depending on how it is written, a Trojan may then delete itself or may remain present to update and maintain the modules."
639,2,Botnet,Others,"Calling back to large social media sites such as GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, the XMPP open source instant message protocol and Tor hidden services are popular ways of avoiding egress filtering to communicate with a C&C server."
640,2,Botnet,Common features,"Most botnets currently feature distributed denial-of-service attacks in which multiple systems submit as many requests as possible to a single Internet computer or service, overloading it and preventing it from servicing legitimate requests."
641,2,Botnet,Common features,An example is an attack on a victim's server.
642,2,Botnet,Common features,"The victim's server is bombarded with requests by the bots, attempting to connect to the server, therefore, overloading it.
"
643,2,Botnet,Common features,"Spyware is software which sends information to its creators about a user's activities – typically passwords, credit card numbers and other information that can be sold on the black market."
644,2,Botnet,Common features,"Compromised machines that are located within a corporate network can be worth more to the bot herder, as they can often gain access to confidential corporate information."
645,2,Botnet,Common features,"Several targeted attacks on large corporations aimed to steal sensitive information, such as the Aurora botnet.
"
646,2,Botnet,Common features,"E-mail spam are e-mail messages disguised as messages from people, but are either advertising, annoying, or malicious.
"
647,2,Botnet,Common features,"Click fraud occurs when the user's computer visits websites without the user's awareness to create false web traffic for personal or commercial gain.
"
648,2,Botnet,Common features,"Bitcoin mining was used in some of the more recent botnets have which include bitcoin mining as a feature in order to generate profits for the operator of the botnet.
"
649,2,Botnet,Common features,"Self-spreading functionality, to seek for pre-configured command-and-control (CNC) pushed instruction contains targeted devices or network, to aim for more infection, is also spotted in several botnets."
650,2,Botnet,Common features,Some of the botnets are utilizing this function to automate their infections.
651,2,Botnet,Market,"The botnet controller community features a constant and continuous struggle over who has the most bots, the highest overall bandwidth, and the most ""high-quality"" infected machines, like university, corporate, and even government machines."
652,2,Botnet,Market,"While botnets are often named after the malware that created them, multiple botnets typically use the same malware but are operated by different entities."
653,2,Botnet,Phishing,Botnets can be used for many electronic scams.
654,2,Botnet,Phishing,These botnets can be used to distribute malware such as viruses to take control of a regular users computer/software
655,2,Botnet,Phishing,"By taking control of someone's personal computer they have unlimited access to their personal information, including passwords and login information to accounts."
656,2,Botnet,Phishing,This is called phishing.
657,2,Botnet,Phishing,"Phishing is the acquiring of login information to the ""victim's"" accounts with a link the ""victim"" clicks on that is sent through an email or text."
658,2,Botnet,Phishing,"A survey by Verizon found that around two-thirds of electronic ""espionage"" cases come from phishing."
659,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"The geographic dispersal of botnets means that each recruit must be individually identified/corralled/repaired and limits the benefits of filtering.
"
660,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"Computer security experts have succeeded in destroying or subverting malware command and control networks, by, among other means, seizing servers or getting them cut off from the Internet, denying access to domains that were due to be used by malware to contact its C&C infrastructure, and, in some cases, breaking into the C&C network itself."
661,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"In response to this, C&C operators have resorted to using techniques such as overlaying their C&C networks on other existing benign infrastructure such as IRC or Tor, using peer-to-peer networking systems that are not dependent on any fixed servers, and using public key encryption to defeat attempts to break into or spoof the network.
"
662,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"Norton AntiBot was aimed at consumers, but most target enterprises and/or ISPs."
663,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,Host-based techniques use heuristics to identify bot behavior that has bypassed conventional anti-virus software.
664,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"Network-based approaches tend to use the techniques described above; shutting down C&C servers, null-routing DNS entries, or completely shutting down IRC servers."
665,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"BotHunter is software, developed with support from the U.S. Army Research Office, that detects botnet activity within a network by analyzing network traffic and comparing it to patterns characteristic of malicious processes.
"
666,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are analyzing botnets' behavior by simultaneously running
667,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"one million Linux kernels—a similar scale to a botnet—as virtual machines on a 4,480-node high-performance computer cluster to emulate a very large network, allowing them to watch how botnets work and experiment with ways to stop them."
668,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,Detecting automated bot attacks is becoming more difficult each day as newer and more sophisticated generations of bots are getting launched by attackers.
669,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"For example, an automated attack can deploy a large bot army and apply brute-force methods with highly accurate username and password lists to hack into accounts."
670,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"The idea is to overwhelm sites with tens of thousands of requests from different IPs all over the world, but with each bot only submitting a single request every 10 minutes or so, which can result in more than 5 million attempts per day."
671,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"In these cases, many tools try to leverage volumetric detection, but automated bot attacks now have ways of circumventing triggers of volumetric detection.
"
672,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"One of the techniques for detecting these bot attacks is what's known as ""signature-based systems"" in which the software will attempt to detect patterns in the request packet."
673,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"But attacks are constantly evolving, so this may not be a viable option when patterns can't be discerned from thousands of requests."
674,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"There's also the behavioral approach to thwarting bots, which ultimately is trying distinguish bots from humans."
675,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"By identifying non-human behavior and recognizing known bot behavior, this process can be applied at the user, browser, and network levels.
"
676,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,The most capable method of using software to combat against a virus has been to utilize honeypot software in order to convince the malware that a system is vulnerable.
677,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,The malicious files are then analyzed using forensic software.
678,2,Botnet,Countermeasures,"On July 15, 2014, the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, held a hearing on the threats posed by botnets and the public and private efforts to disrupt and dismantle them."
679,2,Botnet,Historical list of botnets,The first botnet was first acknowledged and exposed by Earthlink during a lawsuit with notorious spammer Khan C. Smith in 2001 for the purpose of bulk spam accounting for nearly 25% of all spam at the time.
680,2,Botnet,Historical list of botnets,"Around 2006, to thwart detection, some botnets were scaling back in size.
"
681,2,Botnet,Historical list of botnets,"Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara took control of a botnet that was six times smaller than expected."
682,2,Botnet,Historical list of botnets,"In some countries, it is common that users change their IP address a few times in one day."
683,2,Botnet,Historical list of botnets,"Estimating the size of the botnet by the number of IP addresses is often used by researchers, possibly leading to inaccurate assessments."
684,1,Interactive online characters,History,"Radio Rex was the first voice activated toy released in 1911.Another early tool which was enabled to perform digital speech recognition was the IBM Shoebox, presented to the general public during the 1962 Seattle World's Fair after its initial market launch in 1961."
685,1,Interactive online characters,History,"This early computer, developed almost 20 years before the introduction of the first IBM Personal Computer in 1981, was able to recognize 16 spoken words and the digits 0 to 9."
686,1,Interactive online characters,History,"The next milestone in the development of voice recognition technology was achieved in the 1970s at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with substantial support of the United States Department of Defense and its DARPA agency."
687,1,Interactive online characters,History,"Their tool ""Harpy"" mastered about 1000 words, the vocabulary of a three-year-old."
688,1,Interactive online characters,History,About ten years later the same group of scientists developed a system that could analyze not only individual words but entire word sequences enabled by a Hidden Markov Model.
689,1,Interactive online characters,History,"Thus, the earliest virtual assistants, which applied speech recognition software were automated attendant and medical digital dictation software."
690,1,Interactive online characters,History,"In the 1990s digital speech recognition technology became a feature of the personal computer with Microsoft, IBM, Philips and Lernout & Hauspie fighting for customers."
691,1,Interactive online characters,History,Much later the market launch of the first smartphone IBM Simon in 1994 laid the foundation for smart virtual assistants as we know them today.
692,1,Interactive online characters,History,"The first modern digital virtual assistant installed on a smartphone was Siri, which was introduced as a feature of the iPhone 4S on October 4, 2011."

736,1,Interactive online characters,Security,"In addition to unintentional actions and voice recording, another security and privacy risk associated with intelligent virtual assistants is malicious voice commands: An attacker who impersonates a user and issues malicious voice commands to, for example, unlock a smart door to gain unauthorized entry to a home or garage or order items online without the user's knowledge."
737,1,Interactive online characters,Security,"Although some IVAs provide a voice-training feature to prevent such impersonation, it can be difficult for the system to distinguish between similar voices."
738,1,Interactive online characters,Security,"Thus, a malicious person who is able to access an IVA-enabled device might be able to fool the system into thinking that he or she is the real owner and carry out criminal or mischievous acts."
739,2,Wizard (software),History,"Before the 1990s, ""wizard"" was a common term for a technical expert, somewhat akin to ""hacker.""When developing the first version of its desktop publishing software, Microsoft Publisher, around 1991, Microsoft wanted to let users with no graphic design skill make documents that still looked good."
740,2,Wizard (software),History,"Publisher was targeted at non-professionals, and Microsoft figured that, no matter what tools the program had, users wouldn't know what to do with them."
741,2,Wizard (software),History,"Publisher's ""Page Wizards"" instead provided a set of forms to produce a complete document layout, based on a professionally-designed template, which could then be manipulated with the standard tools."
742,2,Wizard (software),History,"Wizards had been in development at Microsoft for several years before Publisher, notably for Microsoft Access, which wouldn't ship until November 1992."
743,2,Wizard (software),History,"Wizards were intended to learn from how someone used a program and anticipate what they may want to do next, guiding them through more complex sets of tasks by structuring and sequencing them."
744,2,Wizard (software),History,They also served to teach the product by example.
745,2,Wizard (software),History,"As early as 1989, Microsoft discussed using voice and talking heads as guides, but multimedia-capable hardware was not yet widespread."
746,2,Wizard (software),History,The feature spread quickly to other applications.
747,2,Wizard (software),History,"In 1992, Excel 4.0 for Mac introduced wizards for tasks like building crosstab tables, and Windows later used wizards for tasks like printer or Internet configuration."
748,2,Wizard (software),History,"By 2001, wizards had become commonplace in most consumer-oriented operating systems, although not always under the name ""wizard."
749,2,Wizard (software),History,"On the Mac OS, starting with tools like the Setup Assistant introduced in Mac OS 8.0, similar tools were (and still are) referred to as ""assistants"" (this is not to be confused with the 'Assist' feature which was on the Apple Newton)."
750,2,Wizard (software),History,"The ""Setup Assistant"" is run when the Macintosh starts up out of the box or after a fresh installation, and a similar process also takes place on Apple iOS."
751,2,Wizard (software),History,"Aside from first time setup, other assistants like the ""Network Setup Assistant"" are similar to the Windows ""New Connection Wizard."
752,2,Wizard (software),History,"GNOME also refers to its wizards as ""assistants"".
"
753,2,Wizard (software),History,"Today, a wizard-like experience is often used to ""onboard"" users the first time they open an app."
754,2,Wizard (software),History,"Many web applications, for instance online booking sites, make use of the wizard paradigm to complete lengthy interactive processes."
755,2,Wizard (software),History,Oracle Designer also uses wizards extensively.
756,2,Wizard (software),History,"The Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications (Version 3.0) urges technical writers to refer to these assistants as ""wizards"" and to use lowercase letters."
757,2,Wizard (software),Example,"The following screenshots show the installation wizard for Kubuntu 12.04, a free and open-source operating system."
758,2,Wizard (software),Example,The wizard consists of seven steps.
759,2,Wizard (software),Example,"By the end of the step seven, the operation will be completed."
760,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"A version of the simulation hypothesis was first theorised as a part of a philosophical argument on the part of René Descartes, and later by Hans Moravec."
761,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,The philosopher Nick Bostrom developed an expanded argument examining the probability of our reality being a simulation.
762,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"His argument states that at least one of the following statements is very likely to be true:

1."
763,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"Human civilization or a comparable civilization is unlikely to reach a level of technological maturity capable of producing simulated realities or such simulations are physically impossible to construct.
"
764,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,2.
765,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"A comparable civilization reaching aforementioned technological status will likely not produce a significant number of simulated realities (one that might push the probable existence of digital entities beyond the probable number of ""real"" entities in a Universe) for any of a number of reasons, such as diversion of computational processing power for other tasks, ethical considerations of holding entities captive in simulated realities, etc.
"
766,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,3.
767,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"Any entities with our general set of experiences are almost certainly living in a simulation.
"
768,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,4.
769,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,We are living in a reality in which posthumans have not developed yet
770,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,and we are actually living in reality.
771,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"Bostrom's argument rests on the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to represent the populated surface of the Earth without recourse to digital physics; that the qualia experienced by a simulated consciousness are comparable or equivalent to those of a naturally occurring human consciousness, and that one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world."
772,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations."
773,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"Epistemologically, it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation."
774,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could pop up saying: ""You are living in a simulation."
775,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,Click here for more information.
776,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"However, imperfections in a simulated environment might be difficult for the native inhabitants to identify and for purposes of authenticity, even the simulated memory of a blatant revelation might be purged programmatically."
777,2,Simulated reality,Simulation argument,"Nonetheless, should any evidence come to light, either for or against the skeptical hypothesis, it would radically alter the aforementioned probability."
778,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,Computationalism is a philosophy of mind theory stating that cognition is a form of computation.
779,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,"It is relevant to the Simulation hypothesis in that it illustrates how a simulation could contain conscious subjects, as required by a ""virtual people"" simulation."
780,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,"For example, it is well known that physical systems can be simulated to some degree of accuracy."
781,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,"If computationalism is correct and if there is no problem in generating artificial consciousness or cognition, it would establish the theoretical possibility of a simulated reality."
782,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,"Nevertheless, the relationship between cognition and phenomenal qualia of consciousness is disputed."
783,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,"It is possible that consciousness requires a vital substrate that a computer cannot provide and that simulated people, while behaving appropriately, would be philosophical zombies."
784,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,"This would undermine Nick Bostrom's simulation argument; we cannot be a simulated consciousness, if consciousness, as we know it, cannot be simulated."
785,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,"The skeptical hypothesis remains intact, however, and we could still be envatted brains, existing as conscious beings within a simulated environment, even if consciousness cannot be simulated."
786,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,"It has been suggested that whereas virtual reality would enable a participant to experience only three senses (sight, sound and optionally smell), simulated reality would enable all five (including taste and touch).Some theorists have argued that if the ""consciousness-is-computation"" version of computationalism and mathematical realism (or radical mathematical Platonism) are true then consciousnesses is computation, which in principle is platform independent and thus admits of simulation."
787,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,"This argument states that a ""Platonic realm"" or ultimate ensemble would contain every algorithm, including those which implement consciousness."
788,2,Simulated reality,Computationalism,"Hans Moravec has explored the simulation hypothesis and has argued for a kind of mathematical Platonism according to which every object (including, for example, a stone) can be regarded as implementing every possible computation."
789,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,A dream could be considered a type of simulation capable of fooling someone who is asleep.
790,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"As a result, the ""dream hypothesis"" cannot be ruled out, although it has been argued that common sense and considerations of simplicity rule against it.  "
791,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"One of the first philosophers to question the distinction between reality and dreams was Zhuangzi, a Chinese philosopher from the 4th century BC.  "
792,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"He phrased the problem as the well-known ""Butterfly Dream,"" which went as follows:

Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased."
793,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,He didn't know he was Zhuangzi.
794,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi."
795,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a butterfly or a butterfly
796,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,dreaming he was Zhuangzi.
797,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be some distinction!
798,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,This is called the Transformation of Things.
799,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"(2, tr."
800,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"Burton Watson 1968:49)
"
801,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"The philosophical underpinnings of this argument are also brought up by Descartes, who was one of the first Western philosophers to do so."
802,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"In Meditations on First Philosophy, he states ""... there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep"", and goes on to conclude that ""It is possible that I am dreaming right now and that all of my perceptions are false"".Chalmers (2003) discusses the dream hypothesis and notes that this comes in two distinct forms:

that he is currently dreaming, in which case many of his beliefs about the world are incorrect;
that he has always been dreaming, in which case the objects he perceives actually exist, albeit in his imagination."
803,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"Both the dream argument and the simulation hypothesis can be regarded as skeptical hypotheses; however in raising these doubts, just as Descartes noted that his own thinking led him to be convinced of his own existence, the existence of the argument itself is testament to the possibility of its own truth."
804,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"Another state of mind in which some argue an individual's perceptions have no physical basis in the real world is called psychosis though psychosis may have a physical basis in the real world and explanations vary.
"
805,2,Simulated reality,Dreaming,"The dream hypothesis is also used to develop other philosophical concepts, such as Valberg's personal horizon: what this world would be internal to if this were all a dream."
806,2,Simulated reality,Existence of simulated reality unprovable in any concrete sense,"Known as the idea of Nested Simulations: the existence of simulated reality is seen to be unprovable in any concrete sense as  there is an infinite regress problem with the argument: any evidence that is directly observed could be another simulation itself.
"
807,2,Simulated reality,Existence of simulated reality unprovable in any concrete sense,"Even if we are a simulated reality, there is no way to be sure the beings running the simulation are not themselves a simulation and the operators of that simulation are not"
808,2,Simulated reality,Existence of simulated reality unprovable in any concrete sense,"a simulation.""Recursive simulation involves a simulation or an entity in the simulation, creating another instance of the same simulation, running it and using its results"" (Pooch and Sullivan 2000).In August 2019, philosopher Preston Greene suggested that it may be best not to find out if we're living in a computer simulation since, if it were found to be true, such knowing may end the simulation."
809,2,Simulated reality,Philosophical and religious implications,Some philosophers and authors (Nick Bostrom's “
810,2,Simulated reality,Philosophical and religious implications,Are You Living In a Computer Simulation?
811,2,Simulated reality,Philosophical and religious implications,"”, Jean Baudrillard's “Simulacra and Simulation”, Iurii Vovchenko's “Answers in Simulation”) tried to address the implications of the simulated reality on mankind's way of life and future."
812,2,Simulated reality,Philosophical and religious implications,"Simulated reality has significant implications to the philosophical questions such as the questions of existence of gods, meaning of life etc."
813,2,Simulated reality,Philosophical and religious implications,There are attempts to link religion to the simulated reality.
814,2,Simulated reality,In fiction,"Simulated reality in fiction has been explored by many authors, game designers and film directors."
815,2,Simulated reality,Major contributing thinkers,"Nick Bostrom and his simulation argument
René Descartes (1596–1650) and his Evil Demon, sometimes also called his 'Evil Genius'

Zhuangzi (around the 4th century BCE) and his Chinese Butterfly Dream"
816,2,Natural language processing,History,"The history of natural language processing (NLP) generally started in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods.
"
817,2,Natural language processing,History,"In 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence.
"
818,2,Natural language processing,History,The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English.
819,2,Natural language processing,History,"The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.  "
820,2,Natural language processing,History,"However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced.  "
821,2,Natural language processing,History,"Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed.
"
822,2,Natural language processing,History,"Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted ""blocks worlds"" with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966.  "
823,2,Natural language processing,History,"Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction."
824,2,Natural language processing,History,"When the ""patient"" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to ""My head hurts"" with ""Why do you say your head hurts?"".
"
825,2,Natural language processing,History,"During the 1970s, many programmers began to write ""conceptual ontologies"", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  "
826,2,Natural language processing,History,"Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  "
827,2,Natural language processing,History,"During this time, many chatterbots were written including PARRY, Racter, and Jabberwacky.
"
828,2,Natural language processing,History,"Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  "
829,2,Natural language processing,History,"Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.  "
830,2,Natural language processing,History,"This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing."
831,2,Natural language processing,History,"Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, produced systems of hard"
832,2,Natural language processing,History,if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules.
833,2,Natural language processing,History,"However, part-of-speech tagging introduced the use of hidden Markov models to natural language processing, and increasingly, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to the features making up the input data."
834,2,Natural language processing,History,The cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.
835,2,Natural language processing,History,"Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.
"
836,2,Natural language processing,History,"Many of the notable early successes occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research, where successively more complicated statistical models were developed.  "
837,2,Natural language processing,History,These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government.
838,2,Natural language processing,History,"However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems."
839,2,Natural language processing,History,"As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.
"
840,2,Natural language processing,History,Recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms.
841,2,Natural language processing,History,"Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data.  "
842,2,Natural language processing,History,"Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data.  "
843,2,Natural language processing,History,"However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical.
"
844,2,Natural language processing,History,"In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, for example in language modeling,
parsing, and many others."
845,2,Natural language processing,History,"Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing)."
846,2,Natural language processing,History,"In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing."
847,2,Natural language processing,History,"For instance, the term neural machine translation (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that were used in statistical machine translation (SMT)."
848,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"In the early days, many language-processing systems were designed by hand-coding a set of rules: such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming.
"
849,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"Since the so-called ""statistical revolution"" in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on machine learning."
850,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora (the plural form of corpus, is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations) of typical real-world examples.
"
851,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,Many different classes of machine-learning algorithms have been applied to natural-language-processing tasks.
852,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"These algorithms take as input a large set of ""features"" that are generated from the input data."
853,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"Some of the earliest-used algorithms, such as decision trees, produced systems of hard"
854,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,if-then rules similar to the systems of handwritten rules that were then common.
855,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"Increasingly, however, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to each input feature."
856,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system.
"
857,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"Systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over handproduced rules:

"
858,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"The learning procedures used during machine learning automatically focus on the most common cases, whereas when writing rules by hand it is often not at all obvious where the effort should be directed.
"
859,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,Automatic learning procedures can make use of statistical-inference algorithms to produce models that are robust to unfamiliar input (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and to erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted).
860,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"Generally, handling such input gracefully with handwritten rules, or, more generally, creating systems of handwritten rules that make soft decisions, is extremely difficult, error-prone and time-consuming.
"
861,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,Systems based on automatically learning the rules can be made more accurate simply by supplying more input data.
862,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"However, systems based on handwritten rules can only be made more accurate by increasing the complexity of the rules, which is a much more difficult task."
863,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"In particular, there is a limit to the complexity of systems based on handcrafted rules, beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable."
864,2,Natural language processing,Rule-based vs. statistical NLP,"However, creating more data to input to machine-learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man-hours worked, generally without significant increases in the complexity of the annotation process."
865,2,Natural language processing,Major evaluations and tasks,The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing.
866,2,Natural language processing,Major evaluations and tasks,"Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.
"
867,2,Natural language processing,Major evaluations and tasks,"Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they are frequently subdivided into categories for convenience."
868,2,Natural language processing,Major evaluations and tasks,A coarse division is given below.
869,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Grammar induction
Generate a formal grammar that describes a language's syntax.
"
870,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Lemmatization
"
871,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"The task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma.
"
872,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Morphological segmentation
Separate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes.  "
873,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology (i.e. the structure of words) of the language being considered.
874,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"English has fairly simple morphology, especially inflectional morphology, and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g. ""open, opens, opened, opening"") as separate words.  "
875,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"In languages such as Turkish or Meitei, a highly agglutinated Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.
"
876,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Part-of-speech tagging
Given a sentence, determine the part of speech (POS) for each word.  "
877,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple parts of speech.  "
878,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"For example, ""book"" can be a noun (""the book on the table"") or verb (""to book a flight""); ""set"" can be a noun, verb or adjective; and ""out"" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.  "
879,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,Some languages have more such ambiguity than others.
880,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Languages with little inflectional morphology, such as English, are particularly prone to such ambiguity."
881,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,Chinese is prone to such ambiguity because it is a tonal language during verbalization.
882,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Such inflection is not readily conveyed via the entities employed within the orthography to convey intended meaning.
"
883,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Parsing
Determine the parse tree (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence.  "
884,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,The grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses.
885,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"In fact, perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human)."
886,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"There are two primary types of parsing, Dependency Parsing and Constituency Parsing."
887,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Dependency Parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (marking things like Primary Objects and predicates), whereas Constituency Parsing focuses on building out the Parse Tree using a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG)."
888,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"See also: Stochastic grammar.
"
889,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Sentence breaking (also known as sentence boundary disambiguation)
"
890,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Given a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries.  "
891,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks, but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g. marking abbreviations).
"
892,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Stemming
"
893,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,The process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their root form.
894,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"(e.g. ""close"" will be the root for ""closed"", ""closing"", ""close"", ""closer"" etc.).
"
895,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Word segmentation
Separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words.  "
896,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"For a language like English, this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces.  "
897,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"However, some written languages like Chinese, Japanese and Thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language."
898,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Sometimes this process is also used in cases like Bag of Words (BOW) creation in data mining.
"
899,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,"Terminology extraction
"
900,2,Natural language processing,Syntax,The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus.
901,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"Lexical semantics
"
902,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"What is the computational meaning of individual words in context?
"
903,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"Distributional semantics
"
904,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"How can we learn semantic representations from data?
"
905,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"Machine translation
Automatically translate text from one human language to another.  "
906,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed ""AI-complete"", i.e. requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.)"
907,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"in order to solve properly.
"
908,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"Named entity recognition (NER)
"
909,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"Given a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g. person, location, organization)."
910,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"Although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient.  "
911,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"For example, the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized.  "
912,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"Furthermore, many other languages in non-Western scripts (e.g. Chinese or Arabic) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names."
913,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"For example, German capitalizes all nouns, regardless of whether they are names, and French and Spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives.

"
915,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,"Natural language understanding
Convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as first-order logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate."
916,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts.
917,2,Natural language processing,Semantics,Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions.

941,2,Natural language processing,Discourse,"Anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer."
942,2,Natural language processing,Discourse,"The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called ""bridging relationships"" involving referring expressions."
943,2,Natural language processing,Discourse,"For example, in a sentence such as ""He entered John's house through the front door"", ""the front door"" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).

"
950,2,Natural language processing,Speech,"Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech.  "
951,2,Natural language processing,Speech,"This is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed ""AI-complete"" (see above).  "
952,2,Natural language processing,Speech,"In natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below)."
953,2,Natural language processing,Speech,"In most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation, so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process."
954,2,Natural language processing,Speech,"Also, given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents, the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent.

960,2,Microsoft Office Assistant,Overview,"According to Alan Cooper, the ""Father of Visual Basic,"" the concept of Clippit was based on a ""tragic misunderstanding"" of research conducted at Stanford University, showing that the same part of the brain in use while using a mouse or keyboard was also responsible for emotional reactions while interacting with other human beings and thus is the reason people yell at their computer monitors."
961,2,Microsoft Office Assistant,Overview,"Microsoft concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software."
962,2,Microsoft Office Assistant,Overview,"As people already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation."

1074,2,Intelligent agent,A variety of definitions,Intelligent agents have been defined in many different ways.
1075,2,Intelligent agent,A variety of definitions,"According to Nikola Kasabov IA systems should exhibit the following characteristics:

Accommodate new problem solving rules incrementally
Adapt online and in real time
Are able to analyze themselves in terms of behavior, error and success.

1077,2,Intelligent agent,A variety of definitions,"memory-based exemplar storage and retrieval capacities
Have parameters to represent short and long term memory, age, forgetting, etc."
1078,2,Intelligent agent,Structure of agents,"A simple agent program can be defined mathematically as a function f (called the ""agent function"") which maps every possible percepts sequence to a possible action the agent can perform or to a coefficient, feedback element, function or constant that affects eventual actions:

  Agent function is an abstract concept as it could incorporate various principles of decision making like calculation of utility of individual options, deduction over logic rules, fuzzy logic, etc."
1083,2,Intelligent agent,Structure of agents,"The program agent, instead, maps every possible percept to an action.
"
1084,2,Intelligent agent,Structure of agents,We use the term percept to refer to the agent's perceptional inputs at any given instant.
1085,2,Intelligent agent,Structure of agents,In the following figures an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.
1086,2,Intelligent agent,Architectures,"Weiss (2013) defines four classes of agents:

Logic-based agents – in which the decision about what action to perform is made via logical deduction;
Reactive agents – in which decision making is implemented in some form of direct mapping from situation to action;
Belief-desire-intention agents – in which decision making depends upon the manipulation of data structures representing the beliefs, desires, and intentions of the agent; and finally,
Layered architectures"
1087,2,Intelligent agent,Architectures,"– in which decision making is realized via various software layers, each of which is more or less explicitly reasoning about the environment at different levels of abstraction."
1088,2,Intelligent agent,Architectures,"Generally, an agent can be constructed by separating the body into the sensors and actuators, and so that it operates with a complex perception system that takes the description of the world as input for a controller and outputs commands to the actuator."
1089,2,Intelligent agent,Architectures,"However, a hierarchy of controller layers is often necessary to balance the immediate reaction desired for low-level tasks and the slow reasoning about complex, high-level goals."
1090,2,Intelligent agent,Classes,"Russell & Norvig (2003) group agents into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability:
simple reflex agents
model-based reflex agents
goal-based agents
utility-based agents
learning agents"
1091,2,Intelligent agent,Simple reflex agents,"Simple reflex agents act only on the basis of the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history."
1092,2,Intelligent agent,Simple reflex agents,"The agent function is based on the condition-action rule: ""if condition, then action"".
"
1093,2,Intelligent agent,Simple reflex agents,This agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable.
1094,2,Intelligent agent,Simple reflex agents,"Some reflex agents can also contain information on their current state which allows them to disregard conditions whose actuators are already triggered.
"
1095,2,Intelligent agent,Simple reflex agents,Infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments.
1096,2,Intelligent agent,Simple reflex agents,"Note: If the agent can randomize its actions, it may be possible to escape from infinite loops."
1097,2,Intelligent agent,Model-based reflex agents,A model-based agent can handle partially observable environments.
1098,2,Intelligent agent,Model-based reflex agents,Its current state is stored inside the agent maintaining some kind of structure which describes the part of the world which cannot be seen.
1099,2,Intelligent agent,Model-based reflex agents,"This knowledge about ""how the world works"" is called a model of the world, hence the name ""model-based agent"".
"
1100,2,Intelligent agent,Model-based reflex agents,A model-based reflex agent should maintain some sort of internal model that depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state.
1101,2,Intelligent agent,Model-based reflex agents,Percept history and impact of action on the environment can be determined by using internal model.
1102,2,Intelligent agent,Model-based reflex agents,"It then chooses an action in the same way as reflex agent.

1221,2,Expert system,Early development,Soon after the dawn of modern computers in the late 1940s
1222,2,Expert system,Early development,"– early 1950s, researchers started realizing the immense potential these machines had for modern society.  "
1223,2,Expert system,Early development,One of the first challenges was to make such machine capable of “thinking” like humans.
1224,2,Expert system,Early development,"In particular, making these machines capable of making important decisions the way humans do.  "
1225,2,Expert system,Early development,The medical / healthcare field presented the tantalizing challenge to enable these machines to make medical diagnostic  decisions.
1226,2,Expert system,Early development,"Thus, in the late 1950's, right after the information age had fully arrived, researchers started experimenting with the prospect of using computer technology to emulate human decision-making."
1227,2,Expert system,Early development,"For example, biomedical researchers started creating computer-aided systems for diagnostic applications in medicine and biology."
1228,2,Expert system,Early development,"These early diagnostic systems used patients' symptoms and laboratory test results as inputs to generate a diagnostic outcome.
"
1229,2,Expert system,Early development,These systems were often described as the early forms of expert systems.
1230,2,Expert system,Early development,"However, researchers had realized that there were significant limitations when using traditional methods such as flow-charts
statistical pattern-matching,  or probability theory."
1231,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"This previous situation gradually led to the development of expert systems, which used knowledge-based approaches.  "
1232,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"These expert systems in medicine were the MYCIN expert system,  the INTERNIST-I expert system and"
1233,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"later, in the middle of the 1980s, the CADUCEUS."
1234,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"Expert systems were formally introduced around 1965 by the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led by Edward Feigenbaum, who is sometimes termed the ""father of expert systems""; other key early contributors were Bruce Buchanan and Randall Davis."
1235,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"The Stanford researchers tried to identify domains where expertise was highly valued and complex, such as diagnosing infectious diseases (Mycin) and identifying unknown organic molecules (Dendral)."
1236,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"The idea that ""intelligent systems derive their power from the knowledge they possess rather than from the specific formalisms and inference schemes they use"" – as Feigenbaum said – was at the time a significant step forward, since the past research had been focused on heuristic computational methods, culminating in attempts to develop very general-purpose problem solvers (foremostly the conjunct work of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon)."
1237,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,Expert systems became some of the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.
1238,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,Research on expert systems was also active in France.
1239,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"While in the US the focus tended to be on rules-based systems, first on systems hard coded on top of LISP programming environments and then on expert system shells developed by vendors such as Intellicorp, in France research focused more on systems developed in Prolog."
1240,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,The advantage of expert system shells was that they were somewhat easier for nonprogrammers to use.
1241,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,The advantage of Prolog environments was that they were not focused only on if-then rules; Prolog environments provided a much better realization of a complete first order logic environment.
1242,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"In the 1980s, expert systems proliferated.  "
1243,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,Universities offered expert system courses and two thirds of the Fortune 500 companies applied the technology in daily business activities.
1244,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"Interest was international with the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project in Japan and increased research funding in Europe.
"
1245,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"In 1981, the first IBM PC, with the PC DOS operating system, was introduced."
1246,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"The imbalance between the high affordability of the relatively powerful chips in the PC, compared to the much more expensive cost of processing power in the mainframes that dominated the corporate IT world at the time, created a new type of architecture for corporate computing, termed the client-server model.  "
1247,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,Calculations and reasoning could be performed at a fraction of the price of a mainframe using a PC.
1248,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,This model also enabled business units to bypass corporate IT departments and directly build their own applications.
1249,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"As a result, client server had a tremendous impact on the expert systems market."
1250,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"Expert systems were already outliers in much of the business world, requiring new skills that many IT departments did not have and were not eager to develop."
1251,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,They were a natural fit for new PC-based shells that promised to put application development into the hands of end users and experts.
1252,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"Until then, the main development environment for expert systems had been high end Lisp machines from Xerox, Symbolics, and Texas Instruments."
1253,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"With the rise of the PC and client server computing, vendors such as Intellicorp and Inference Corporation shifted their priorities to developing PC based tools."
1254,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"Also, new vendors, often financed by venture capital (such as Aion Corporation, Neuron Data, Exsys, and many others), started appearing regularly.
"
1255,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"The first expert system to be used in a design capacity for a large-scale product was the SID (Synthesis of Integral Design) software program, developed in 1982."
1256,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"Written in LISP, SID generated 93% of the VAX 9000 CPU logic gates."
1257,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,Input to the software was a set of rules created by several expert logic designers.
1258,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,SID expanded the rules and generated software logic synthesis routines many times the size of the rules themselves.
1259,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"Surprisingly, the combination of these rules resulted in an overall design that exceeded the capabilities of the experts themselves, and in many cases out-performed the human counterparts.  "
1260,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"While some rules contradicted others, top-level control parameters for speed and area provided the tie-breaker."
1261,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"The program was highly controversial, but used nevertheless due to project budget constraints."
1262,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"It was terminated by logic designers after the VAX 9000 project completion.
"
1263,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"During the years before the middle of the 1970s, the expectations of what expert systems can accomplish in many fields tended to be extremely optimistic.  "
1264,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"At the beginning of these early studies, researchers were hoping to develop entirely automatic (i.e., completely computerized) expert systems."
1265,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,The expectations of people of what computers can do were frequently too idealistic.
1266,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,This situation radically changed after Richard M. Karp published his breakthrough paper:
1267,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,“Reducibility among Combinatorial Problems” in the early 1970s.
1268,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,Thanks to Karp's work it became clear that there are certain limitations and possibilities when one designs computer algorithms.
1269,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,His findings describe what computers can do and what they cannot do.
1270,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,Many of the computational problems related to this type of expert systems have certain pragmatic limitations.
1271,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,These findings laid down the groundwork that led to the next developments in the field.
1272,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"In the 1990s and beyond, the term expert system and the idea of a standalone AI system mostly dropped from the IT lexicon."
1273,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,There are two interpretations of this.
1274,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"One is that ""expert systems failed"": the IT world moved on because expert systems did not deliver on their over hyped promise."
1275,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"The other is the mirror opposite, that expert systems were simply victims of their success: as IT professionals grasped concepts such as rule engines, such tools migrated from being standalone tools for developing special purpose expert systems, to being one of many standard tools.  "
1276,2,Expert system,Formal introduction & later developments,"Many of the leading major business application suite vendors (such as SAP, Siebel, and Oracle) integrated expert system abilities into their suite of products as a way of specifying business logic – rule engines are no longer simply for defining the rules an expert would use but for any type of complex, volatile, and critical business logic; they often go hand in hand with business process automation and integration environments."
1277,2,Expert system,Current approaches to expert systems,The limitations of the previous type of expert systems have urged researchers to develop new types of approaches.
1278,2,Expert system,Current approaches to expert systems,"They have developed more efficient, flexible and powerful approaches in order to emulate the human decision-making process."
1279,2,Expert system,Current approaches to expert systems,"Some of the approaches that researchers have developed are based on new methods of artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular in machine learning and data mining approaches with a feedback mechanism.  "
1280,2,Expert system,Current approaches to expert systems,"Related is the discussion on the disadvantages section.
"
1281,2,Expert system,Current approaches to expert systems,Modern systems can incorporate new knowledge more easily and thus update themselves easily.
1282,2,Expert system,Current approaches to expert systems,Such systems can generalize from existing knowledge better and deal with vast amounts of complex data.
1283,2,Expert system,Current approaches to expert systems,Related is the subject of big data here.
1284,2,Expert system,Current approaches to expert systems,Sometimes these type of expert systems are called “intelligent systems.
1285,2,Expert system,Software architecture,An expert system is an example of a knowledge-based system.
1286,2,Expert system,Software architecture,Expert systems were the first commercial systems to use a knowledge-based architecture.
1287,2,Expert system,Software architecture,A knowledge-based system is essentially composed of two sub-systems: the knowledge base and the inference engine.
1288,2,Expert system,Software architecture,The knowledge base represents facts about the world.
1289,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"In early expert systems such as Mycin and Dendral, these facts were represented mainly as flat assertions about variables."
1290,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"In later expert systems developed with commercial shells, the knowledge base took on more structure and used concepts from object-oriented programming."
1291,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"The world was represented as classes, subclasses, and instances and assertions were replaced by values of object instances."
1292,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"The rules worked by querying and asserting values of the objects.
"
1293,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"The inference engine is an automated reasoning system that evaluates the current state of the knowledge-base, applies relevant rules, and then asserts new knowledge into the knowledge base."
1294,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"The inference engine may also include abilities for explanation, so that it can explain to a user the chain of reasoning used to arrive at a particular conclusion by tracing back over the firing of rules that resulted in the assertion."
1295,2,Expert system,Software architecture,There are mainly two modes for an inference engine: forward chaining and backward chaining.
1296,2,Expert system,Software architecture,The different approaches are dictated by whether the inference engine is being driven by the antecedent (left hand side) or the consequent (right hand side) of the rule.
1297,2,Expert system,Software architecture,In forward chaining an antecedent fires and asserts the consequent.
1298,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"For example, consider the following rule:

A simple example of forward chaining would be to assert Man(Socrates) to the system and then trigger the inference engine."
1299,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"It would match R1 and assert Mortal(Socrates) into the knowledge base.
"
1300,2,Expert system,Software architecture,Backward chaining is a bit less straight forward.
1301,2,Expert system,Software architecture,In backward chaining the system looks at possible conclusions and works backward to see if they might be true.
1302,2,Expert system,Software architecture,So if the system was trying to determine if Mortal(Socrates) is true it would find R1 and query the knowledge base to see if Man(Socrates) is true.
1303,2,Expert system,Software architecture,One of the early innovations of expert systems shells was to integrate inference engines with a user interface.
1304,2,Expert system,Software architecture,This could be especially powerful with backward chaining.
1305,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"If the system needs to know a particular fact but does not, then it can simply generate an input screen and ask the user if the information is known."
1306,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"So in this example, it could use R1 to ask the user if Socrates was a Man and then use that new information accordingly.
"
1307,2,Expert system,Software architecture,The use of rules to explicitly represent knowledge also enabled explanation abilities.
1308,2,Expert system,Software architecture,In the simple example above if the system had used R1 to assert that Socrates was Mortal and a user wished to understand why Socrates was mortal they could query the system and the system would look back at the rules which fired to cause the assertion and present those rules to the user as an explanation.
1309,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"In English if the user asked ""Why is Socrates Mortal?"
1310,2,Expert system,Software architecture,""" the system would reply ""Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man"".  "
1311,2,Expert system,Software architecture,A significant area for research was the generation of explanations from the knowledge base in natural English rather than simply by showing the more formal but less intuitive rules.
1312,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"As expert systems evolved, many new techniques were incorporated into various types of inference engines."
1313,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"Some of the most important of these were:

Truth maintenance."
1314,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"These systems record the dependencies in a knowledge-base so that when facts are altered, dependent knowledge can be altered accordingly."
1315,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"For example, if the system learns that Socrates is no longer known to be a man it will revoke the assertion that Socrates is mortal.
Hypothetical reasoning."
1316,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"In this, the knowledge base can be divided up into many possible views, a.k.a. worlds."
1317,2,Expert system,Software architecture,This allows the inference engine to explore multiple possibilities in parallel.
1318,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"For example, the system may want to explore the consequences of both assertions, what will be true if Socrates is a Man and what will be true if he is not?
"
1319,2,Expert system,Software architecture,Uncertainty systems.
1320,2,Expert system,Software architecture,One of the first extensions of simply using rules to represent knowledge was also to associate a probability with each rule.
1321,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"So, not to assert that Socrates is mortal, but to assert Socrates may be mortal with some probability value."
1322,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"Simple probabilities were extended in some systems with sophisticated mechanisms for uncertain reasoning, such as Fuzzy logic, and combination of probabilities.
"
1323,2,Expert system,Software architecture,Ontology classification.
1324,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"With the addition of object classes to the knowledge base, a new type of reasoning was possible."
1325,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"Along with reasoning simply about object values, the system could also reason about object structures."
1326,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"In this simple example, Man can represent an object class and R1 can be redefined as a rule that defines the class of all men.  "
1327,2,Expert system,Software architecture,These types of special purpose inference engines are termed classifiers.
1328,2,Expert system,Software architecture,"Although they were not highly used in expert systems, classifiers are very powerful for unstructured volatile domains, and are a key technology for the Internet and the emerging Semantic Web."
1329,2,Expert system,Advantages,The goal of knowledge-based systems is to make the critical information required for the system to work explicit rather than implicit.
1330,2,Expert system,Advantages,In a traditional computer program the logic is embedded in code that can typically only be reviewed by an IT specialist.
1331,2,Expert system,Advantages,"With an expert system the goal was to specify the rules in a format that was intuitive and easily understood, reviewed, and even edited by domain experts rather than IT experts."
1332,2,Expert system,Advantages,"The benefits of this explicit knowledge representation were rapid development and ease of maintenance.
"
1333,2,Expert system,Advantages,Ease of maintenance is the most obvious benefit.
1334,2,Expert system,Advantages,This was achieved in two ways.
1335,2,Expert system,Advantages,"First, by removing the need to write conventional code, many of the normal problems that can be caused by even small changes to a system could be avoided with expert systems.  "
1336,2,Expert system,Advantages,"Essentially, the logical flow of the program (at least at the highest level) was simply a given for the system, simply invoke the inference engine."
1337,2,Expert system,Advantages,This also was a reason for the second benefit: rapid prototyping.
1338,2,Expert system,Advantages,"With an expert system shell it was possible to enter a few rules and have a prototype developed in days rather than the months or year typically associated with complex IT projects.
"
1339,2,Expert system,Advantages,A claim for expert system shells that was often made was that they removed the need for trained programmers and that experts could develop systems themselves.
1340,2,Expert system,Advantages,"In reality, this was seldom if ever true."
1341,2,Expert system,Advantages,"While the rules for an expert system were more comprehensible than typical computer code, they still had a formal syntax where a misplaced comma or other character could cause havoc as with any other computer language."
1342,2,Expert system,Advantages,"Also, as expert systems moved from prototypes in the lab to deployment in the business world, issues of integration and maintenance became far more critical."
1343,2,Expert system,Advantages,"Inevitably demands to integrate with, and take advantage of, large legacy databases and systems arose."
1344,2,Expert system,Advantages,"To accomplish this, integration required the same skills as any other type of system."
1345,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,The most common disadvantage cited for expert systems in the academic literature is the knowledge acquisition problem.
1346,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"Obtaining the time of domain experts for any software application is always difficult, but for expert systems it was especially difficult because the experts were by definition highly valued and in constant demand by the organization."
1347,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"As a result of this problem, a great deal of research in the later years of expert systems was focused on tools for knowledge acquisition, to help automate the process of designing, debugging, and maintaining rules defined by experts."
1348,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"However, when looking at the life-cycle of expert systems in actual use, other problems – essentially the same problems as those of any other large system – seem at least as critical as knowledge acquisition: integration, access to large databases, and performance."
1349,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,Performance could be especially problematic because early expert systems were built using tools (such as earlier Lisp versions) that interpreted code expressions without first compiling them.
1350,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"This provided a powerful development environment, but with the drawback that it was virtually impossible to match the efficiency of the fastest compiled languages (such as C)."
1351,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"System and database integration were difficult for early expert systems because the tools were mostly in languages and platforms that were neither familiar to nor welcome in most corporate IT environments – programming languages such as Lisp and Prolog, and hardware platforms such as Lisp machines and personal computers."
1352,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"As a result, much effort in the later stages of expert system tool development was focused on integrating with legacy environments such as COBOL and large database systems, and on porting to more standard platforms."
1353,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"These issues were resolved mainly by the client-server paradigm shift, as PCs were gradually accepted in the IT environment as a legitimate platform for serious business system development and as affordable minicomputer servers provided the processing power needed for AI applications."
1354,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,Another major challenge of expert systems emerges when the size of the knowledge base increases.
1355,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,This causes the processing complexity to increase.
1356,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"For instance, when an expert system with 100 million rules was envisioned as the ultimate expert system, it became obvious that such system would be too complex and it would face too many computational problems."
1357,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"An inference engine would have to be able to process huge numbers of rules to reach a decision.
"
1358,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,How to verify that decision rules are consistent with each other is also a challenge when there are too many rules.
1359,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,Usually such problem leads to a satisfiability (SAT) formulation.
1360,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,This is a well-known NP-complete problem Boolean satisfiability problem.
1361,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"If we assume only binary variables, say n of them, and then the corresponding search space is of size 2






            n




    {\displaystyle ^{n}}
  .  "
1362,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"Thus, the search space can grow exponentially.
"
1363,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"There are also questions on how to prioritize the use of the rules in order to operate more efficiently, or how to resolve ambiguities (for instance, if there are too many else-if sub-structures within a single rule) and so on."
1364,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,Other problems are related to the overfitting and overgeneralization effects when using known facts and trying to generalize to other cases not described explicitly in the knowledge base.
1365,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,Such problems exist with methods that employ machine learning approaches too.
1366,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,Another problem related to the knowledge base is how to make updates of its knowledge quickly and effectively.
1367,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"Also how to add a new knowledge (i.e., where to add among many rules) is challenging.  "
1368,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"Modern approaches that rely on machine learning methods are easier in this regard.
"
1369,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"Because of the above challenges, it became clear that a new approaches to AI were required instead of rule-based technologies.  "
1370,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"These new approaches are based on the use of machine learning techniques, along with the use of feedback mechanisms."
1371,2,Expert system,Disadvantages,"The key challenges that expert systems in medicine (if one considers computer-aided diagnostic systems as modern expert systems), and perhaps in other application domains, include issues related to aspects such as: big data, existing regulations, healthcare practice, various algorithmic issues, and system assessment."
1372,2,Expert system,Applications,Hayes-Roth divides expert systems applications into 10 categories illustrated in the following table.
1373,2,Expert system,Applications,"The example applications were not in the original Hayes-Roth table, and some of them arose well afterward."
1374,2,Expert system,Applications,Any application that is not footnoted is described in the Hayes-Roth book.
1375,2,Expert system,Applications,"Also, while these categories provide an intuitive framework to describe the space of expert systems applications, they are not rigid categories, and in some cases an application may show traits of more than one category.

"
1376,2,Expert system,Applications,Hearsay was an early attempt at solving voice recognition through an expert systems approach.
1377,2,Expert system,Applications,For the most part this category or expert systems was not all that successful.
1378,2,Expert system,Applications,Hearsay and all interpretation systems are essentially pattern recognition systems—looking for patterns in noisy data.
1379,2,Expert system,Applications,In the case of Hearsay recognizing phonemes in an audio stream.
1380,2,Expert system,Applications,Other early examples were analyzing sonar data to detect Russian submarines.
1381,2,Expert system,Applications,"These kinds of systems proved much more amenable to a neural network AI solution than a rule-based approach.
"
1382,2,Expert system,Applications,CADUCEUS and MYCIN were medical diagnosis systems.
1383,2,Expert system,Applications,"The user describes their symptoms to the computer as they would to a doctor and the computer returns a medical diagnosis.
"
1384,2,Expert system,Applications,Dendral was a tool to study hypothesis formation in the identification of organic molecules.
1385,2,Expert system,Applications,"The general problem it solved—designing a solution given a set of constraints—was one of the most successful areas for early expert systems applied to business domains such as salespeople configuring Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX computers and mortgage loan application development.
"
1386,2,Expert system,Applications,SMH.PAL is an expert system for the assessment of students with multiple disabilities.
1387,2,Expert system,Applications,"Mistral  is an expert system to monitor dam safety, developed in the 90's by Ismes (Italy)."
1388,2,Expert system,Applications,It gets data from an automatic monitoring system and performs a diagnosis of the state of the dam.
1389,2,Expert system,Applications,"Its first copy, installed in 1992 on the Ridracoli Dam (Italy), is still operational 24/7/365."
1390,2,Expert system,Applications,"It has been installed on several dams in Italy and abroad (e.g., Itaipu Dam in Brazil), and on landslide sites under the name of Eydenet, and on monuments under the name of Kaleidos."
1391,2,Expert system,Applications,Mistral is a registered trade mark of CESI.
1392,2,Computer facial animation,History,Human facial expression has been the subject of scientific investigation for more than one hundred years.
1393,2,Computer facial animation,History,Study of facial movements and expressions started from a biological point of view.
1394,2,Computer facial animation,History,"After some older investigations, for example by John Bulwer in the late 1640s, Charles Darwin's book The Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals can be considered a major departure for modern research in behavioural biology.
"
1395,2,Computer facial animation,History,Computer based facial expression modelling and animation is not a new endeavour.
1396,2,Computer facial animation,History,The earliest work with computer based facial representation was done in the early-1970s.
1397,2,Computer facial animation,History,The first three-dimensional facial animation was created by Parke in 1972.
1398,2,Computer facial animation,History,"In 1973, Gillenson developed an interactive system to assemble and edit line drawn facial images."
1399,2,Computer facial animation,History,"in 1974, Parke developed a parameterized three-dimensional facial model.
"
1400,2,Computer facial animation,History,One of the most important attempts to describe facial movements was Facial Action Coding System (FACS).
1401,2,Computer facial animation,History,"Originally developed by Carl-Herman Hjortsjö  in the 1960s and updated by Ekman and Friesen in 1978, FACS defines 46 basic facial Action Units (AUs)."
1402,2,Computer facial animation,History,"A major group of these Action Units represent primitive movements of facial muscles in actions such as raising brows, winking, and talking."
1403,2,Computer facial animation,History,"Eight AU's are for rigid three-dimensional head movements, (i.e. turning and tilting left and right and going up, down, forward and backward)."
1404,2,Computer facial animation,History,"FACS has been successfully used for describing desired movements of synthetic faces and also in tracking facial activities.
"
1405,2,Computer facial animation,History,The early-1980s saw the development of the first physically based muscle-controlled face model by Platt and the development of techniques for facial caricatures by Brennan.
1406,2,Computer facial animation,History,"In 1985, the animated short film Tony de Peltrie was a landmark for facial animation."
1407,2,Computer facial animation,History,"This marked the first time computer facial expression and speech animation were a fundamental part of telling the story.
"
1408,2,Computer facial animation,History,"The late-1980s saw the development of a new muscle-based model by Waters, the development of an abstract muscle action model by Magnenat-Thalmann and colleagues, and approaches to automatic speech synchronization by Lewis and Hill."
1409,2,Computer facial animation,History,"The 1990s have seen increasing activity in the development of facial animation techniques and the use of computer facial animation as a key storytelling component as illustrated in animated films such as Toy Story (1995), Antz (1998), Shrek, and Monsters,"
1410,2,Computer facial animation,History,"Inc. (both 2001), and computer games such as Sims.  "
1411,2,Computer facial animation,History,"Casper (1995), a milestone in this decade, was the first movie in which a lead actor was produced exclusively using digital facial animation.
"
1412,2,Computer facial animation,History,The sophistication of the films increased after 2000.
1413,2,Computer facial animation,History,"In The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, dense optical flow from several high-definition cameras was used to capture realistic facial movement at every point on the face."
1414,2,Computer facial animation,History,Polar Express (film) used a large Vicon system to capture upward of 150 points.
1415,2,Computer facial animation,History,"Although these systems are automated, a large amount of manual clean-up effort is still needed to make the data usable."
1416,2,Computer facial animation,History,"Another milestone in facial animation was reached by The Lord of the Rings, where a character specific shape base system was developed."
1417,2,Computer facial animation,History,"Mark Sagar pioneered the use of FACS in entertainment facial animation, and FACS based systems developed by Sagar were used on Monster House, King Kong, and other films."
1418,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,The generation of facial animation data can be approached in different ways:
1419,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"1.) marker-based motion capture on points or marks on the face of a performer, 2.) markerless motion capture techniques using different type of cameras, 3.)"
1420,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"audio-driven techniques, and 4.)"
1421,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"keyframe animation.

"
1422,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Motion capture uses cameras placed around a subject.
1423,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,The subject is generally fitted either with reflectors (passive motion capture) or sources (active motion capture) that precisely determine the subject's position in space.
1424,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,The data recorded by the cameras is then digitized and converted into a three-dimensional computer model of the subject.
1425,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"Until recently, the size of the detectors/sources used by motion capture systems made the technology inappropriate for facial capture."
1426,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"However, miniaturization and other advancements have made motion capture a viable tool for computer facial animation."
1427,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Facial motion capture was used extensively in Polar Express by Imageworks where hundreds of motion points were captured.
1428,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"This film was very accomplished and while it attempted to recreate realism, it was criticized for having fallen in the 'uncanny valley', the realm where animation realism is sufficient for human recognition and to convey the emotional message but where the characters fail to be perceived as realistic."
1429,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"The main difficulties of motion capture are the quality of the data which may include vibration as well as the retargeting of the geometry of the points.
"
1430,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Markerless motion capture aims at simplifying the motion capture process by avoiding encumbering the performer with markers.
1431,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"Several techniques came out recently leveraging different sensors, among which standard video cameras, Kinect and depth sensors or other structured-light based devices.  "
1432,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Systems based on structured light may achieve real-time performance without the use of any markers using a high speed structured light scanner.
1433,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,The system is based on a robust offline face tracking stage which trains the system with different facial expressions.
1434,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"The matched sequences are used to build a person-specific linear face model that is subsequently used for online face tracking and expression transfer.
"
1435,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Audio-driven techniques are particularly well fitted for speech animation.
1436,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"Speech is usually treated in a different way to the animation of facial expressions, this is because simple keyframe-based approaches to animation typically provide a poor approximation to real speech dynamics."
1437,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"Often visemes are used to represent the key poses in observed speech (i.e. the position of the lips, jaw and tongue when producing a particular phoneme), however there is a great deal of variation in the realisation of visemes during the production of natural speech."
1438,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,The source of this variation is termed coarticulation which is the influence of surrounding visemes upon the current viseme (i.e. the effect of context).
1439,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"To account for coarticulation current systems either explicitly take into account context when blending viseme keyframes or use longer units such as diphone, triphone, syllable or even word and sentence-length units."
1440,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,One of the most common approaches to speech animation is the use of dominance functions introduced by Cohen and Massaro.
1441,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Each dominance function represents the influence over time that a viseme has on a speech utterance.
1442,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Typically the influence will be greatest at the center of the viseme and will degrade with distance from the viseme center.
1443,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Dominance functions are blended together to generate a speech trajectory in much the same way that spline basis functions are blended together to generate a curve.
1444,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"The shape of each dominance function will be different according to both which viseme it represents and what aspect of the face is being controlled (e.g. lip width, jaw rotation etc.)."
1445,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,This approach to computer-generated speech animation can be seen in the Baldi talking head.
1446,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"Other models of speech use basis units which include context (e.g. diphones, triphones etc.) instead of visemes."
1447,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"As the basis units already incorporate the variation of each viseme according to context and to some degree the dynamics of each viseme, no model of coarticulation is required."
1448,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Speech is simply generated by selecting appropriate units from a database and blending the units together.
1449,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,This is similar to concatenative techniques in audio speech synthesis.
1450,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"The disadvantage to these models is that a large amount of captured data is required to produce natural results, and whilst longer units produce more natural results the size of database required expands with the average length of each unit."
1451,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"Finally, some models directly generate speech animations from audio."
1452,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,These systems typically use hidden markov models or neural nets to transform audio parameters into a stream of control parameters for a facial model.
1453,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"The advantage of this method is the capability of voice context handling, the natural rhythm, tempo, emotional and dynamics handling without complex approximation algorithms."
1454,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"The training database is not needed to be labeled since there are no phonemes or visemes needed; the only needed data is the voice and the animation parameters.
"
1455,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Keyframe animation is the least automated of the processes to create animation data although it delivers the maximum amount of control over the animation.
1456,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,It is often used in combination with other techniques to deliver the final polish to the animation.
1457,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,The keyframe data can be made of scalar values defining the morph targets coefficients or rotation and translation values of the bones in models with a bone based rig.
1458,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,Often to speed up the keyframe animation process a control rig is used by the animation.
1459,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,The control rig represents a higher level of abstraction that can act on multiple morph targets coefficients or bones at the same time.
1460,2,Computer facial animation,Generating facial animation data,"For example, a ""smile"" control can act simultaneously on the mouth shape curving up and the eyes squinting."
1461,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,The main techniques used to apply facial animation to a character are: 1.)
1462,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"morph targets animation, 2.)"
1463,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"bone driven animation, 3.) texture-based animation ("
1464,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"2D or 3D), and 4.) physiological models.

"
1465,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"Morph targets (also called ""blendshapes"") based systems offer a fast playback as well as a high degree of fidelity of expressions."
1466,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"The technique involves modeling portions of the face mesh to approximate expressions and visemes and then blending the different sub meshes, known as morph targets or blendshapes."
1467,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"Perhaps the most accomplished character using this technique was Gollum, from The Lord of the Rings."
1468,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,Drawbacks of this technique are that they involve intensive manual labor and are specific to each character.
1469,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"Recently, new concepts in 3D modeling have started to emerge.  "
1470,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"Recently, a new technology departing from the traditional techniques starts to emerge, such as Curve Controlled Modeling  that emphasizes the modeling of the movement of a 3D object instead of the traditional modeling of the static shape.
"
1471,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,Bone driven animation is very broadly used in games.
1472,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,The bones setup can vary between few bones to close to a hundred to allow all subtle facial expressions.
1473,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"The main advantages of bone driven animation is that the same animation can be used for different characters as long as the morphology of their faces is similar, and secondly they do not require loading in memory all the Morph targetsdata."
1474,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,Bone driven animation is most widely supported by 3D game engines.
1475,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,Bone driven animation can be used both 2D and 3D animation.
1476,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"For example, it is possible to rig and animated using bones a 2D character using Adobe Flash.
"
1477,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,Texture-based animation uses pixel color to create the animation on the character face.
1478,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"2D facial animation is commonly based upon the transformation of images, including both images from still photography and sequences of video."
1479,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,Image morphing is a technique which allows in-between transitional images to be generated between a pair of target still images or between frames from sequences of video.
1480,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"These morphing techniques usually consist of a combination of a geometric deformation technique, which aligns the target images, and a cross-fade which creates the smooth transition in the image texture."
1481,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"An early example of image morphing can be seen in Michael Jackson's video for ""Black Or White""."
1482,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,In 3D animation texture based animation can be achieved by animating the texture itself or the UV mapping.
1483,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"In the latter case a texture map of all the facial expression is created and the UV map animation is used to transition from one expression to the next.
"
1484,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"Physiological models, such as skeletal muscle systems and physically based head models, form another approach in modeling the head and face."
1485,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"Here, the physical and anatomical characteristics of bones, tissues, and skin are simulated to provide a realistic appearance (e.g. spring-like elasticity)."
1486,2,Computer facial animation,Applying facial animation to a character,"Such methods can be very powerful for creating realism but the complexity of facial structures make them computationally expensive, and difficult to create."

2157,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,Machine learning tasks are classified into several broad categories.
2158,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,"In supervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs."
2159,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,"For example, if the task were determining whether an image contained a certain object, the training data for a supervised learning algorithm would include images with and without that object (the input), and each image would have a label (the output) designating whether it contained the object."
2160,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,"In special cases, the input may be only partially available, or restricted to special feedback."
2161,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,"Semi-supervised learning algorithms develop mathematical models from incomplete training data, where a portion of the sample input doesn't have labels.
"
2162,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,Classification algorithms and regression algorithms are types of supervised learning.
2163,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values.
2164,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,"For a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email."
2165,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,"For an algorithm that identifies spam emails, the output would be the prediction of either ""spam"" or ""not spam"", represented by the Boolean values true and false."
2166,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,"Regression algorithms are named for their continuous outputs, meaning they may have any value within a range."

"
2172,2,Applications of machine learning,Machine learning tasks,"Active learning algorithms access the desired outputs (training labels) for a limited set of inputs based on a budget, and optimize the choice of inputs for which it will acquire training labels."

2180,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term ""Machine Learning"" in 1959 while at IBM."
2181,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"A representative book of the machine learning research during 1960s was the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification."
2182,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"The interest of machine learning related to pattern recognition continued during 1970s, as described in the book of Duda and Hart in 1973.
"
2183,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence."
2184,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data."
2185,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics."
2186,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis."
2187,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning."
2188,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.
2189,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor."
2190,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval."

2196,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory."
2197,2,Applications of machine learning,History and relationships to other fields,"It also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information, and the ability to distribute it via the Internet."
2198,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to data mining,"Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases)."
2199,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to data mining,"Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy."
2200,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to data mining,"Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge."
2201,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to data mining,"Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data."
2202,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to optimization,Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples.
2203,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to optimization,"Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples)."
2204,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to optimization,"The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples."
2205,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to statistics,"Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns."
2206,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to statistics,"According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics."
2207,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to statistics,He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.
2208,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to statistics,"Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,"
2209,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to statistics,"wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest.
"
2210,2,Applications of machine learning,Relation to statistics,"Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning."
2211,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.
2212,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set."
2213,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.
"
2214,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.
2215,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms."
2216,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common."
2217,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.
"
2218,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data."
2219,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data."
2220,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases."
2221,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer."
2222,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning."
2223,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,"In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time."
2224,2,Applications of machine learning,Theory,There are two kinds of time complexity results.

2279,2,Applications of deep learning,Definition,Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input.
2280,2,Applications of deep learning,Definition,"For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces."
2281,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"Most modern deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks, specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)s, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines."
2282,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"In deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation."
2283,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face."
2284,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own."
2285,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"(Of course, this does not completely eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.)The word ""deep"" in ""deep learning"" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed."
2286,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth."
2287,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output.
2288,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output.
2289,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized)."
2290,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited."
2291,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"No universally agreed upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2."
2292,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function.
2293,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network."
2294,2,Applications of deep learning,Overview,"Deep models (CAP > 2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively.

2301,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem or probabilistic inference.
2302,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions.
2303,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,"In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik."
2304,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as the rectified linear unit.
2305,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow.
2306,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,"Lu et al. proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function; If the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then deep neural network is not a universal approximator.
"
2307,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,The probabilistic interpretation derives from the field of machine learning.
2308,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,"It features inference, as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fitting and generalization, respectively."
2309,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,"More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function."
2310,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks.
2311,2,Applications of deep learning,Interpretations,"The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield, Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop."
2312,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"The term Deep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons."

2318,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"By 1991 such systems were used for recognizing isolated 2-D hand-written digits, while recognizing 3-D objects was done by matching 2-D images with a handcrafted 3-D object model."
2319,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"Weng et al. suggested that a human brain does not use a monolithic 3-D object model and in 1992 they published Cresceptron, a method for performing 3-D object recognition in cluttered scenes."
2320,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"Because it directly used natural images, Cresceptron started the beginning of general-purpose visual learning for natural 3D worlds."
2321,2,Applications of deep learning,History,Cresceptron is a cascade of layers similar to Neocognitron.
2322,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"But while Neocognitron required a human programmer to hand-merge features, Cresceptron learned an open number of features in each layer without supervision, where each feature is represented by a convolution kernel."
2323,2,Applications of deep learning,History,Cresceptron segmented each learned object from a cluttered scene through back-analysis through the network.
2324,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"Max pooling, now often adopted by deep neural networks (e.g. ImageNet tests), was first used in Cresceptron to reduce the position resolution by a factor of (2x2) to 1 through the cascade for better generalization.
"
2325,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"In 1994, André de Carvalho, together with Mike Fairhurst and David Bisset, published experimental results of a multi-layer boolean neural network, also known as a weightless neural network, composed of a 3-layers self-organising feature extraction neural network module (SOFT) followed by a multi-layer classification neural network module (GSN), which were independently trained."
2326,2,Applications of deep learning,History,Each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer.
2327,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"In 1995, Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train (over two days) a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, co-developed with Peter Dayan and Hinton."
2328,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"Many factors contribute to the slow speed, including the vanishing gradient problem analyzed in 1991 by Sepp Hochreiter."
2329,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"Simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural network's (ANN) computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.
"
2330,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs have been explored for many years."

2338,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"While SRI experienced success with deep neural networks in speaker recognition, they were unsuccessful in demonstrating similar success in speech recognition.
"
2339,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"The principle of elevating ""raw"" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the ""raw"" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms."
2340,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"The raw features of speech, waveforms, later produced excellent larger-scale results."
2341,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"Many aspects of speech recognition were taken over by a deep learning method called long short-term memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network published by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997."
2342,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"LSTM RNNs avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn ""Very Deep Learning"" tasks that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before, which is important for speech."
2343,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"In 2003, LSTM started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks."
2344,2,Applications of deep learning,History,Later it was combined with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) in stacks of LSTM RNNs.

2355,2,Applications of deep learning,History,It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets.
2356,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems."
2357,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems."
2358,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"Analysis around 2009-2010, contrasted the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition, eventually leading to pervasive and dominant use in that industry."
2359,2,Applications of deep learning,History,That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models.
2360,2,Applications of deep learning,History,"In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees."
